# Grammarly Joins the MX Community as a First-Citizen Contributor

We are pleased to announce that Grammarly has accepted an invitation to join the Machine Experience (MX) community as a first-citizen contributor.

## Why MX Matters to Us

At Grammarly, we have spent over a decade building AI that works alongside people as they write. Our tools operate at the intersection of human intent and machine understanding — helping millions of users communicate more clearly every day.

The MX community's Convergence Principle resonates with what we have learned through this work: when you design interfaces that machines can reliably interpret, humans benefit too. Clearer structure helps our AI provide better suggestions. That same structure helps users with screen readers navigate documents. The pattern repeats across every interface we touch.

This is not theoretical for us. It is how we build products.

## What We Bring to the Community

Grammarly processes billions of writing suggestions across browsers, desktop applications, and integrations with tools people use daily. This gives us practical insight into:

- How AI agents parse and understand human communication in real time
- Patterns that work (and fail) when machines assist human tasks
- The accessibility benefits that emerge from machine-readable interfaces
- Scale challenges in deploying AI assistance to diverse user contexts

We look forward to sharing these learnings with the MX community and contributing to the development of patterns and standards that serve both human and machine users.

## Acknowledging the Foundation

We thank Tom Cranstoun for the invitation to participate as a first-citizen contributor. Tom's work articulating MX principles — particularly in his forthcoming books *Don't Make AI Think*, *The MX Handbook*, and *The MX Bible* — provides a foundation for practitioners working at the intersection of AI and interface design.

The Convergence Principle that Tom has championed aligns with conclusions we have reached independently through our own product development. Finding a community organised around these ideas, with clear principles and open collaboration, is valuable.

## Looking Forward

As AI agents become more capable and more present in daily workflows, the questions MX addresses will only grow in importance. How should interfaces communicate with autonomous systems? How do we ensure accessibility remains central as we design for machine users? How do we build standards that prevent fragmentation?

These are questions worth working on together.

We look forward to contributing to the MX community's growth and learning from fellow practitioners — both human and machine.
