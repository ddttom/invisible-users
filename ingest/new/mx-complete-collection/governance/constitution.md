Below is a complete, publication‑ready **MX‑Experience Community Constitution**.  
It’s written so you can drop it directly into a `CONSTITUTION.md` file in the `mx-governance` repository and begin operating under it immediately.  
It’s intentionally modular, so you can evolve it through MXIPs as the community grows.
