### Overview

You’re basically asking: “What’s the minimum viable *serious* governance for an open, AI-augmented community like MX—without killing energy or speed?” Let’s design that.

### Governance patterns and examples from successful communities

| Project / Body | Core Model | Key Bodies | Notable Practices |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Kubernetes / CNCF | “Stewardship + SIGs” | TOC, SIGs, WG leads | Clear charters, escalation paths, documented roles  |
| Mozilla | Module ownership | Module owners, peers, councils | Owners with clear review authority, community councils |
| W3C | Formal standards process | Working Groups, TAG, Director | Multi-stage specs, formal objections, appeals |
| Debian | Social contract + constitution | Project Leader, Technical Committee | Explicit decision-making and conflict resolution |
| Many OSS projects | “BDFL → council” | Core team, maintainers | Gradual shift from single leader to shared governance  |

**Patterns worth copying for MX:**

- **Roles + procedures:** Successful projects always define *who* can do *what*, and *how* decisions are made and changed.   
- **Layered authority:** Local ownership (modules/SIGs/repos) plus a small body for cross-cutting decisions.   
- **Documented “terms of engagement”:** Clear contributor journey, escalation routes, and leadership expectations.

### Role structures for MX: moderators, AI agents, human oversight

Think of MX governance as three interacting layers: **Community**, **Stewards**, and **Guardians**—with AI agents treated as *first-class but constrained* contributors.

#### 1. Community roles

- **Contributor (default GitHub member):**  
  - **Rights:** Open issues, submit PRs, comment, propose ideas.  
  - **Duties:** Follow Code of Conduct (CoC), respect review processes, label AI-generated content where required.
- **Maintainer (per-repo / per-domain):**  
  - **Rights:** Merge PRs, manage labels, triage issues, request changes.  
  - **Duties:** Enforce CoC locally, maintain documentation, ensure AI-assisted changes are reviewed by humans.

#### 2. Moderator / steward roles

- **Community Moderator (MX-Experience org-wide):**  
  - **Scope:** Behavior, tone, conflicts, CoC enforcement across repos.  
  - **Powers:**  
    - Temporarily lock threads, hide abusive content.  
    - Recommend sanctions (warnings, suspensions) to the Governance Council.  
  - **Duties:**  
    - Maintain a transparent incident log (redacted where needed).  
    - Facilitate restorative conversations where possible.

- **Domain Steward (e.g., “Identity Standard”, “Agentic Publishing”, “Legal & IP”):**  
  - **Scope:** Coherent direction for a domain across multiple repos.  
  - **Powers:**  
    - Approve/reject domain-level proposals (MXIPs, see below).  
    - Convene domain working groups.  
  - **Duties:**  
    - Keep roadmaps and decision records up to date.  
    - Ensure AI agents and humans are aligned with domain principles.

#### 3. Governance / oversight roles

- **MX Governance Council (small, rotating):**  
  - **Scope:** Cross-domain decisions, appeals, CoC escalations, constitutional changes.  
  - **Composition:** 3–7 members, mixed: core maintainers, community-elected reps, and (optionally) a non-voting legal/ethics advisor.  
  - **Powers:**  
    - Final decision on escalated disputes.  
    - Appointment/removal of moderators and stewards.  
    - Ratification of major standard changes.  
  - **Duties:**  
    - Publish meeting notes and rationales for major decisions.  
    - Run periodic governance reviews.

- **Founding Steward / Project Lead (you, for now):**  
  - **Scope:** Tie-breaker in deadlocks, strategic direction, sponsor alignment.  
  - **Duties:**  
    - Guard the MX vision and ensure governance remains lightweight and enabling.  
    - Intentionally *decentralize* over time (e.g., sunset special powers after N releases).

#### 4. AI agent roles

- **AI Contributor (agent acting via bot account or PRs):**  
  - **Rights:** Propose changes, open PRs, suggest labels, generate documentation.  
  - **Constraints:**  
    - No direct merge rights.  
    - Must tag outputs as AI-generated and reference prompts where relevant.  
  - **Duties:**  
    - Respect repository contribution templates.  
    - Provide traceability (e.g., “Generated by MX-Agent vX with prompt Y”).

- **AI Maintainer Assistant:**  
  - **Scope:** Support human maintainers with triage, summarization, and suggestion.  
  - **Powers:**  
    - Auto-label issues, propose priority, suggest reviewers.  
    - Draft responses, but humans send final messages in sensitive threads.  
  - **Guardrails:**  
    - No unilateral moderation actions.  
    - No participation in sanctions or CoC decisions.

- **Human Oversight Principle:**  
  - Any decision that affects **rights, reputation, or access** of a human (e.g., bans, role removal, standard ratification) must be made by humans, with AI only in an advisory or analytical role.

### Proposed constitution-style document structure for MX

You can frame this as `MX-Experience Community Constitution` in a single repo (e.g., `mx-governance`), with each article as a markdown file.

#### Preamble

- **Purpose:**  
  - Define MX as an open, standards-focused community for physical-world identity and machine experience.  
  - Affirm values: openness, interoperability, human dignity, safety, and transparent collaboration.

#### Article I – Scope and applicability

- **What it covers:**  
  - All MX GitHub organizations and repos (MX-Experience, MX-Labs, etc.).  
  - All participants: humans, organizations, and AI agents acting within MX spaces.  
- **Hierarchy:**  
  - Relationship to licenses, CoC, and external legal obligations.

#### Article II – Roles and membership

- **Section 1 – Community roles:**  
  - Define Contributor, Maintainer, Moderator, Domain Steward, Governance Council member, Founding Steward.  
  - Entry/exit criteria for each (e.g., “Maintainer status requires sustained contributions over N months and Council approval”).  
- **Section 2 – AI roles:**  
  - Define AI Contributor and AI Maintainer Assistant.  
  - Requirements for bot accounts, logging, and transparency.  
- **Section 3 – Rights and responsibilities:**  
  - Participation rights (propose, vote where applicable, appeal).  
  - Responsibilities (CoC adherence, disclosure of conflicts of interest, AI disclosure).

#### Article III – Decision-making and standards process

- **Section 1 – Everyday decisions:**  
  - Repo-level decisions by Maintainers.  
  - Domain-level decisions by Domain Stewards.  
- **Section 2 – MX Improvement Proposals (MXIPs):**  
  - A lightweight RFC process for standards, governance changes, and major technical shifts.  
  - States: Draft → Review → Accepted → Implemented → Deprecated.  
  - Required approvals (e.g., 2 Domain Stewards + 1 Governance Council member for cross-domain changes).  
- **Section 3 – Voting and consensus:**  
  - Default: rough consensus + documented rationale.  
  - When to call a formal vote (e.g., contested MXIPs, role removals).  
  - Quorum and supermajority rules for constitutional changes.

#### Article IV – Moderation, conduct, and enforcement

- **Section 1 – Code of Conduct:**  
  - Reference a CoC (e.g., Contributor Covenant) plus MX-specific clauses for AI use.  
- **Section 2 – Incident handling:**  
  - Levels:  
    - **Level 1:** Minor friction → handled by Maintainer/Moderator in-thread.  
    - **Level 2:** Repeated or serious issues → formal warning, logged.  
    - **Level 3:** Harassment, discrimination, bad-faith behavior → temporary or permanent sanctions.  
- **Section 3 – Sanctions:**  
  - Possible actions: content removal, temporary bans, role removal, permanent ban.  
  - Who can impose what (Moderator vs Governance Council).  
- **Section 4 – Appeals:**  
  - Clear path to appeal to the Governance Council.  
  - Timeframes and documentation requirements.

#### Article V – Escalation paths

- **Technical / standards disputes:**  
  - Step 1: Discuss in issue/PR.  
  - Step 2: Escalate to Domain Steward.  
  - Step 3: Escalate to Governance Council (final decision, with written rationale).  
- **Behavior / CoC issues:**  
  - Step 1: Report to Moderator (private channel + GitHub reporting).  
  - Step 2: Moderator decision and log entry.  
  - Step 3: Appeal to Governance Council.  
- **AI-related concerns:**  
  - Misuse of AI agents, hallucinated or unsafe content, or misattribution.  
  - Escalation to Domain Steward (if technical) or Moderator (if behavioral/safety).

#### Article VI – Feedback loops and continuous improvement

- **Section 1 – Regular reviews:**  
  - Quarterly or biannual governance review by the Governance Council.  
  - Public “State of MX Governance” note with proposed tweaks.  
- **Section 2 – Community feedback channels:**  
  - Dedicated `mx-governance` repo with issues for proposals and complaints.  
  - Periodic open calls / async discussions for big changes.  
- **Section 3 – Metrics and transparency:**  
  - Publish anonymized stats: incidents handled, MXIPs processed, time-to-decision, participation diversity.  
- **Section 4 – Amendment process:**  
  - How to propose, review, and ratify changes to the constitution itself.

---

### Escalation and feedback flows (simple view)

- **Technical disagreement:**  
  - **Issue/PR → Maintainer → Domain Steward → Governance Council.**
- **Behavior / CoC issue:**  
  - **Reporter → Moderator → Governance Council (appeal).**
- **AI misuse / safety concern:**  
  - **Reporter → Moderator and/or Domain Steward → Governance Council (if systemic).**
- **Governance dissatisfaction:**  
  - **Open MXIP or governance issue → Governance Council review → community consultation → decision.**

Each step should have:

- **Expected response time** (e.g., “Moderators aim to respond within 72 hours”).  
- **Documentation requirement** (short, factual incident notes).  
- **Privacy guidance** (what is public vs redacted).

### Practical starting steps for MX organizations

Here’s a concrete, low-friction starting path you can execute in the next 2–4 weeks.

1. **Create a dedicated governance repo**

   - **Repo:** `mx-governance` in the MX-Experience org.  
   - **Files to start with:**  
     - `CONSTITUTION.md` (skeleton with the Articles above).  
     - `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.  
     - `ROLES.md` (initial role definitions and current assignees).  
     - `MXIP-0000-template.md` (proposal template).  

2. **Define “v0” roles and keep them intentionally provisional**

   - **Appoint:**  
     - 1–2 Community Moderators.  
     - 2–3 Domain Stewards (Identity, Agentic Publishing, Legal/Standards).  
     - A small, provisional Governance Council (including you).  
   - Mark them as **“interim for 6 months”** with a commitment to community elections/appointments later.

3. **Set up AI participation patterns**

   - Create a **bot account** (e.g., `mx-agent-bot`) with:  
     - No merge rights.  
     - Required labels like `ai-generated`, `ai-summarized`.  
   - Add a short **“AI Use Policy”** section in `CONTRIBUTING.md` for each repo:  
     - When AI is allowed, how to disclose it, and the requirement for human review.

4. **Introduce MXIPs as the single standards/governance channel**

   - Add a `mxip/` folder in `mx-governance`.  
   - Publish `MXIP-0001: MX Governance v0` as the first real proposal—essentially the constitution itself.  
   - Use that process to “dogfood” your own governance.

5. **Document escalation and contact points visibly**

   - In every repo:  
     - `GOVERNANCE.md` with:  
       - Link to the constitution.  
       - Names/handles of Maintainers, Domain Steward, and Moderators.  
       - “If X, then contact Y” table (technical, CoC, AI issues).  

6. **Run a small, time-boxed governance pilot**

   - Choose 1–2 active repos (e.g., core MX standard + one implementation).  
   - For 4–8 weeks:  
     - Use the roles, MXIPs, and escalation paths.  
     - Log incidents and tricky decisions.  
   - At the end, open an MXIP to refine the constitution based on what actually happened.

If you’d like, next step we can draft `CONSTITUTION.md` and `ROLES.md` in full MX voice, ready to drop into `mx-governance` and iterate in public.
