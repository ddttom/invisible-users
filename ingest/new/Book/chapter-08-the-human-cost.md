# Chapter 8 - The Human Cost

Everything discussed so far assumes resources. Developer time, technical expertise, modern devices, reliable internet, money for subscriptions. The ability to read English fluently.

Not everyone has these.

When I talk about AI agents transforming web interaction, I'm describing a future that will arrive unevenly. Some people will gain substantial advantages. Others will be left behind. And the gap between them may widen before it narrows.

This chapter examines who benefits from agent-mediated web access, who doesn't, and what we might do about the disparity.

## The Access Problem

AI agents require several things to function:

**Technology requirements:**
- A modern device (smartphone or computer)
- Reliable internet connectivity
- Access to agent platforms (often subscription-based)
- Sometimes specific browser capabilities

**Human requirements:**
- Technical literacy to set up and direct agents
- Language skills (primarily English)
- Understanding of what agents can and cannot do
- Time to learn effective usage patterns

**Who has all of these?**

Primarily affluent, educated, English-speaking people in developed countries with good internet infrastructure.

**Who lacks one or more?**

- People in developing countries with limited or expensive internet
- Elderly people less comfortable with new technology
- People with limited income who cannot afford subscriptions
- People who speak languages agents support poorly
- People in rural areas with unreliable connectivity
- People with certain disabilities affecting device use
- People with lower education or technical exposure

This creates an immediate division. Those with full access gain efficiency advantages. Those without full access gain nothing - and may fall further behind relatively.

## The Capability Gap

Even among people who can access agents, effectiveness varies enormously.

Using an AI agent well requires skills that aren't evenly distributed:

**Prompt crafting** - Knowing how to phrase requests clearly. "Book me a hotel" produces worse results than "Find hotels in central Manchester for two adults, December 20-22, under £150 per night, with free cancellation."

**Error recognition** - Knowing when an agent's response is wrong, incomplete, or misleading. This requires enough domain knowledge to evaluate the output.

**Iteration skills** - Understanding how to refine requests when initial results aren't satisfactory. Knowing which details to add, which to remove, which to rephrase.

**Security awareness** - Understanding what information is safe to share with agents, what risks exist, and how to protect sensitive data.

**Task decomposition** - Breaking complex goals into steps an agent can execute. Knowing when to handle something yourself versus delegating.

These are learned skills. People with more education, higher technical literacy, and greater exposure to AI tools develop them faster. People without these advantages struggle - and may not even realise they're getting suboptimal results.

The agent becomes a productivity multiplier. But multipliers amplify existing differences. Someone who already works efficiently becomes dramatically more efficient. Someone who struggles continues to struggle, perhaps more so.

## The Language Exclusion

AI agents work best in English.

This isn't surprising. Most AI training data is English-language text. Most development teams work primarily in English. Most documentation and support resources are English-first.

**Current language support quality varies:**

- English: Excellent
- Spanish, French, German: Good
- Italian, Portuguese, Dutch: Decent
- Mandarin, Japanese, Korean: Moderate
- Hindi, Arabic, Russian: Limited
- Smaller languages: Minimal or absent

**The implications are significant.**

If web interaction increasingly happens through English-optimised agents, non-English speakers face a choice: use agents in a second language (poorly), or don't use agents at all.

Content creation follows incentives. If agents struggle with Welsh or Swahili or Tagalog, there's less reason to create agent-friendly content in those languages. The existing bias toward English-language content accelerates.

Cultural expression suffers. Idioms, humour, local references, culturally-specific concepts - these translate poorly even when the words translate accurately. Agent-mediated interaction flattens cultural nuance.

**This amounts to technological linguistic imperialism.** Not through deliberate policy, but through the accumulated effect of design decisions that treat English as default and everything else as an afterthought.

The web was supposed to connect cultures. Agent-mediated web access may homogenise them instead.

## The Age Divide

Different generations have different relationships with technology.

**Younger people generally:**
- Grew up with digital technology
- Adapt quickly to new tools
- Understand AI capabilities intuitively
- Feel comfortable experimenting

**Older people often:**
- Learned technology later in life
- Adapt more slowly to changes
- May distrust AI systems
- Prefer familiar interaction patterns

This isn't universal - plenty of older people embrace new technology, and some younger people struggle with it. But the pattern exists broadly enough to matter.

**The risk is exclusion from services.**

Banking increasingly happens online. Government services migrate to digital portals. Healthcare moves to apps and patient portals. Shopping shifts to e-commerce.

If these services optimise for agent interaction, and agents don't work well for people who can't direct them effectively, older populations lose access to services they need.

This isn't hypothetical. It's already happening with app-only banking, online-only government forms, and digital-first healthcare portals. Agent optimisation accelerates the trend.

**The counter-argument:** agents could help older people by simplifying complex digital interactions. "Help me pay my council tax" is easier than navigating a confusing government website.

This is true - when it works. But it requires:
- Access to an agent
- Ability to articulate the request
- Trust in the agent to handle it correctly
- Backup options when it fails

For many older people, one or more of these is missing.

## The Disability Question

The relationship between agents and disability is complicated. Some disabilities benefit significantly from agent access. Others may be harmed.

**Potential benefits:**

Visual impairments: Agents can describe visual content, navigate visually-complex interfaces, and complete tasks that require seeing.

Motor impairments: Agents can complete tasks that require precise clicking, dragging, typing - physical interactions that may be difficult.

Cognitive impairments: Agents can simplify complex information, break tasks into steps, provide reminders and guidance.

Reading difficulties: Agents can read content aloud, summarise long text, explain difficult passages.

**Potential harms:**

Assistive technology conflicts: Existing screen readers, voice control systems, and accessibility tools may not integrate well with agent interfaces.

Interface accessibility: The agent's own interface may not be accessible. Chat interfaces can be difficult for screen readers. Voice interfaces may not work for speech impairments.

Instruction complexity: Directing an agent effectively requires clear communication. Some cognitive impairments make this difficult.

**The risk of double exclusion:**

If websites optimise for agents while neglecting traditional accessibility, people who cannot use agents and have disabilities face compounded barriers. The human-accessible interface degrades because resources shift to agent optimisation. The agent interface doesn't work for them either.

This isn't inevitable. Agent-friendly design and accessibility-friendly design overlap substantially - both require clear structure, explicit state, semantic markup. But the overlap isn't complete, and priorities can diverge.

## The Education Gap

Effective agent use is a skill. Skills require learning. Learning opportunities aren't equally distributed.

**What effective agent use requires:**

Understanding capabilities: Knowing what agents can actually do, not what marketing claims suggest.

Understanding limitations: Recognising tasks that agents handle poorly or cannot handle at all.

Critical evaluation: Assessing whether agent outputs are accurate, complete, and appropriate.

Privacy awareness: Understanding data implications of agent interactions.

Prompt engineering: Crafting requests that produce useful results.

Error recovery: Handling failures constructively rather than giving up or accepting bad outcomes.

**Who learns these skills?**

People in technical fields encounter agents through work. People in higher education have opportunities for formal or informal learning. People in wealthy communities have access to workshops, courses, and knowledgeable peers.

People without these advantages learn through trial and error - if they learn at all. Many will use agents ineffectively, trust outputs they shouldn't trust, share information they shouldn't share, and give up on tasks that would have succeeded with better technique.

**The knowledge gap compounds over time.**

Early effective users build experience. Their skills improve. They tackle more complex tasks. They gain more advantage.

Late or ineffective users fall further behind. Tasks that seem simple to experienced users remain difficult. The gap between skilled and unskilled agent users widens.

We've seen this pattern before with basic computer literacy, internet search skills, and social media navigation. Agent literacy will follow the same trajectory unless deliberately addressed.

## The Economic Divide

Agent access has real costs.

**Direct costs:**
- Premium AI subscriptions: £20-50 per month
- Higher-tier access for advanced features: £100+ per month
- API usage for heavy users: variable, potentially substantial
- Device costs: modern smartphone or computer

**Indirect costs:**
- Reliable internet: ongoing expense
- Time investment: learning curve has opportunity cost
- Occasional failures: when agents make expensive mistakes

**For affluent users, these costs are trivial.** £20 per month for a tool that saves hours of time is an obvious investment. Premium tiers that unlock more capability are affordable luxuries.

**For low-income users, these costs are significant.** £20 per month is grocery money. Premium tiers are unthinkable. The cost-benefit calculation looks very different when money is tight.

**The economic advantages compound:**

Agents help find better deals. But you need agent access to find them.

Agents help compare financial products. But you need agent access to compare them.

Agents help navigate complex bureaucracy. But you need agent access to navigate it.

Agents help identify opportunities. But you need agent access to identify them.

Each advantage accrues to those who can already afford access. The rich get richer - not through malice, but through differential access to productivity-enhancing tools.

**Free tiers exist but are limited.** Basic access to ChatGPT or Claude is free. But free tiers have usage limits, capability restrictions, and may lack the features that provide the most value. The best tools remain behind paywalls.

## Geographic Complications

Agents don't exist in physical space, but their users do. This creates problems.

**The location mismatch:**

An agent might run on servers in Virginia while its user sits in Manchester. When the agent accesses a website, the site sees Virginia. It shows US content, US prices, US availability.

The user gets wrong information because the agent isn't where they are.

**Regional content restrictions:**

Streaming services vary by region. "Is this show available?" might get a yes based on US availability when the user is in the UK where it's not available.

E-commerce sites have different product ranges, prices, and shipping options by region. An agent checking from the wrong location reports incorrect information.

**Currency confusion:**

Site shows $99, £85, €92. Which price applies? Depends on where the user is and how they'll pay. Agents often grab the wrong number.

**Shipping restrictions:**

"Can I buy this?" Yes, agent says. Checkout: "We don't ship to your location."

**Legal compliance variation:**

GDPR cookie banners in Europe. Different consent requirements in California. Content restrictions in various countries. An agent's experience varies based on where it appears to be located.

**What's needed:**

Agents should declare user location explicitly, separate from agent location. Sites should respond with location-appropriate content. Neither consistently happens today.

## Language Beyond Translation

Language issues extend beyond which languages agents support.

**Idioms and cultural references:**

"It's raining cats and dogs" translates literally to nonsense in most languages. Agents working across languages may miss or mangle such expressions.

**Technical terminology:**

Domain-specific terms may not have clear equivalents. Medical, legal, technical vocabulary differs across languages in ways that simple translation misses.

**Formality levels:**

Some languages have elaborate formality systems. Japanese keigo, Korean honorifics, German Sie/du distinctions. Agents often flatten these, producing text that's technically correct but socially inappropriate.

**Script and input:**

Languages using non-Latin scripts face additional input challenges. Right-to-left languages may render incorrectly. Character encoding issues persist.

**The compounding effect:**

Errors in understanding multiply errors in output. An agent that slightly misunderstands a French query produces a response that's slightly wrong, which the user might accept because they're not sure if the problem is the agent or their own comprehension.

## What Can Be Done

These problems aren't inevitable. They're design choices and policy decisions. Different choices would produce different outcomes.

**For platform providers:**

Maintain meaningful free tiers. Not crippled demos, but genuinely useful access that lets low-income users benefit from agent capabilities.

Invest in non-English languages. Not as afterthoughts, but as first-class supported languages with comparable capability.

Design for accessibility from the start. Agent interfaces should work with screen readers, voice control, and other assistive technologies.

Simplify interaction patterns. Not everyone can craft elaborate prompts. Agents should work reasonably well with simple, natural requests.

Provide educational resources. Help users learn effective techniques without requiring courses or technical backgrounds.

**For website operators:**

Don't sacrifice human interfaces for agent optimisation. Both should work well. The convergence described in earlier chapters suggests this is achievable.

Keep accessibility central. Agent-friendly and human-accessible overlap substantially. Design for both simultaneously.

Support multiple languages genuinely. Not just translation, but culturally-appropriate content and interaction patterns.

Test with diverse users. Not just tech-savvy early adopters, but people with varying abilities, ages, backgrounds, and technical comfort levels.

**For policymakers:**

Ensure essential services remain accessible without agents. Banking, healthcare, government services must work for people who can't or won't use AI assistance.

Monitor for exclusion. Track whether agent-optimised services are leaving populations behind. Require remediation when they do.

Fund digital literacy. Public libraries, community centres, schools should teach effective and safe agent use, just as they taught internet skills a generation ago.

Consider access requirements. If agents become necessary infrastructure, like internet access or mobile phones, access policies should follow.

**For users with privilege:**

Advocate for inclusion. Those who benefit from agent access can push for broader access.

Support training efforts. Share knowledge with those learning to use agents effectively.

Provide feedback. Report when agents fail for non-English languages, accessibility needs, or other edge cases. Visibility drives improvement.

## The Uncomfortable Reality

Technology transitions tend to benefit the already-privileged first.

Personal computers were expensive initially. Wealthy households adopted them first. Their children gained computer literacy advantages that persisted for years.

Internet access came to affluent areas first. Broadband created further divides. Those with fast connections accessed opportunities unavailable to those with dialup or nothing.

Smartphones started as premium devices. Early adopters gained mobile-first skills and benefits. Budget options eventually democratised access, but the early advantage persisted.

**AI agents follow the same pattern.** Premium subscriptions, technical literacy requirements, English-language bias, device and connectivity needs - all favour those who already have advantages.

**Eventually, technology often democratises.** Computers became affordable. Internet reached most areas. Smartphones are now nearly universal. The pattern suggests AI agent access will broaden over time.

**But "eventually" can take decades.** And during that transition, inequality increases. Those who adopt early gain compounding advantages. Those who adopt late - or never - fall further behind.

The question isn't whether agents will become more accessible. They almost certainly will. The question is how quickly, how completely, and how much inequality accumulates during the transition.

**If we're intentional about access, education, and affordability, the transition can be faster and more equitable.**

If we leave it to market forces alone, the gap will be wider and last longer.

## The Parallel to Earlier Chapters

This chapter connects to everything before it.

The invisible failures of Chapter 2 - toast notifications, pagination, ambiguous state - hurt users who can't effectively direct agents to work around them. Those same patterns often hurt users with disabilities, limited technical literacy, or cognitive load constraints.

The architectural conflicts of Chapter 3 - human cognition versus machine parsing - play out differently for different humans. Some can work around bad interfaces more easily than others.

The business pressures of Chapter 4 - engagement versus efficiency, data collection, customer relationships - shape which users get served and which get neglected.

The security challenges of Chapter 6 - authentication, delegation, session management - create additional barriers for users who struggle with complex technical processes.

The legal uncertainties of Chapter 7 - liability, terms of service, privacy regulations - affect users differently based on their sophistication and resources.

**The human cost isn't separate from the technical and business issues. It emerges from them.**

Design decisions about web interfaces ripple outward. They affect who can participate in the digital economy, who can access services, who gets left behind. The technical is political.

## The Optimistic Case

This chapter has been pessimistic. Let me offer some counterbalance.

**Agents could be great equalisers.** Someone who struggles with complex forms could have an agent complete them. Someone who can't easily search and compare could have an agent do it. Someone who finds bureaucratic processes overwhelming could have an agent navigate them.

**Language barriers could fall.** An agent that translates on the fly, understanding cultural context, could connect people across linguistic divides more effectively than current tools.

**Accessibility could improve.** If agents become sophisticated enough to handle any interface on behalf of any user, the specific accessibility of individual websites matters less. The agent becomes a universal accessibility layer.

**Geographic barriers could diminish.** An agent that handles regional variations, currency conversions, shipping restrictions could make global commerce more accessible than ever.

**For these optimistic outcomes to materialise, the technology must develop in particular ways:**

Free access must remain meaningful as capabilities improve.

Language support must extend to minority languages, not just commercially valuable ones.

Accessibility must be designed in, not bolted on.

Geographic and cultural variation must be respected, not flattened.

**None of this happens automatically.** It happens because people push for it, fund it, design for it, regulate for it. Optimistic outcomes require intentional effort.

## What I Hope Readers Take Away

If you build websites, consider who can and cannot use them - both directly and through agents. Design for the full range of your potential users, not just the easiest cases.

If you build agents, consider who can and cannot use them effectively. Invest in accessibility, language support, and simplified interaction patterns. Don't assume all users are technical, affluent, English-speaking.

If you make policy, recognise that agent access is becoming important infrastructure. Ensure essential services remain accessible to those without agents. Fund education and access programmes. Monitor for exclusion.

If you have agent access and use it effectively, remember that your experience isn't universal. Advocate for those who don't have what you have.

The web's promise was universal access to information and services. That promise has always been imperfectly fulfilled. The transition to agent-mediated interaction can bring us closer to that promise - or further from it.

The outcome isn't determined by technology. It's determined by choices.
