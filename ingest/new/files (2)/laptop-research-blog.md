# The Invisible Buyer: How AI Changed My Laptop Purchase

> **Note:** This account is fictionalised, but the scenario is entirely plausible. AI assistants can and do hallucinate product features, and the dynamics described here are already affecting e-commerce. The specific transaction is illustrative; the pattern is real.

I needed a laptop. Specifically, a Snapdragon-based machine with 5G connectivity and an HDMI port. What followed was an exercise that would have been unrecognisable five years ago – and one that should concern every retailer reading this.

## The Requirements

My brief was simple enough:
- Snapdragon X Elite or X Plus processor (for battery life and efficiency)
- Built-in 5G WWAN (for connectivity without tethering)
- HDMI port (for presentations and external displays)
- Decent specs for consultancy work

## The Research Process

I didn't visit a single retailer website to browse. I didn't click through product categories, filter by specification, or add items to a comparison list. Instead, I described what I wanted to an AI assistant and let it work.

Within minutes, the assistant had:

1. **Searched current 5G laptop options** – identifying the main players across several manufacturers' business ranges

2. **Filtered by my requirements** – the HDMI requirement eliminated most Snapdragon laptops immediately. One competitor's flagship? No HDMI. Another's ultrabook variant? No HDMI. The field narrowed quickly.

3. **Identified the winner** – a business laptop emerged as essentially the only Snapdragon laptop with 5G, HDMI, and a proper port selection (including RJ-45 Ethernet)

4. **Found UK pricing** – from the manufacturer's direct store down to trade suppliers, with prices ranging from £746 to £1,800 depending on specification and 5G inclusion

5. **Surfaced the gotchas** – the 5G module must be specified at purchase; it cannot be added later

The entire process took perhaps fifteen minutes of conversation.

## What the Retailers Saw

Nothing.

<figcaption>Figure 1: The visibility gap. The entire research process – manufacturers compared, models evaluated, retailers checked – happened in conversation with an AI. The winning retailer saw only the final transaction.</figcaption>
</figure>

The winning manufacturer didn't see me weighing their laptop against competitors. Other manufacturers didn't see me eliminate their models for missing HDMI ports. The tablet maker didn't see me briefly consider and dismiss the form factor entirely.

The trade supplier who emerged as the price leader at £746 for the base model had no idea they were even in contention until I had their product code and price in hand.

The retailers' carefully constructed product pages, their comparison tools, their "customers also viewed" recommendations, their chatbots – all bypassed entirely. Years of investment in digital customer experience, rendered invisible.

## The Purchase Funnel Has Moved

Traditional e-commerce assumes a funnel: awareness, consideration, evaluation, purchase. Retailers have built entire infrastructures around capturing and nurturing customers through each stage. Analytics track every click. Remarketing follows abandoned carts. Email sequences drip on the hesitant.

But when an AI assistant does the research, the funnel collapses to a single point. The retailer sees only the final transaction – if they're lucky enough to be the one selected.

Consider what information was lost:

- **No browsing history** – I didn't visit product pages, so there's no data about what I considered
- **No search queries** – my questions went to an AI, not a site search box
- **No filters applied** – my requirements were expressed in natural language, not checkbox clicks
- **No comparison activity** – the AI compared options internally, not on a retailer's comparison tool
- **No cart abandonment** – I never added anything to a cart until ready to buy
- **No email capture** – no newsletter signup, no "notify me when back in stock"

The retailer who wins my business will know only that someone bought a specific SKU. They won't know why I chose them (price), what else I considered (everything), or what nearly disqualified them (nothing, in this case – they simply had the best price).

## The Machine Experience Implication

This is what I've been calling Machine Experience – the emerging discipline of designing for AI intermediaries rather than human browsers. When machines are doing the research, the rules change.

Product data becomes more important than product pages. Structured specifications matter more than persuasive copy. Price competitiveness is exposed ruthlessly, because an AI will find the cheapest supplier in seconds.

The retailers who thrive will be those whose product information is:
- Accurate and complete
- Structured in ways AI can parse
- Consistent across channels
- Updated in real-time

The ones who struggle will be those still optimising for human psychology: hero images, emotional appeals, artificial urgency. An AI doesn't care that "only 3 left in stock!" It cares whether the product meets the specification.

## The Numbers

For the record, here's where I landed:

| Model | Config | 5G | HDMI | UK Price |
|-------|--------|-----|------|----------|
| a business laptop | Snapdragon X, 16GB, 512GB | No | Yes | ~£746 (trade supplier) |
| a business laptop | Snapdragon X, 32GB, 1TB | Yes | Yes | ~£1,600-1,800 (direct) |

The 5G premium is substantial – roughly £850-1,000 extra. For that price difference, phone tethering looks increasingly attractive.

## The Future State: When AI Holds the Wallet

What I've described is the present – AI as research assistant, human as final decision-maker. But this is a transitional state. The trajectory is clear.

**Phase 1 (Now):** AI researches, human decides, human purchases.

**Phase 2 (Imminent):** AI researches, AI recommends, human approves, AI purchases.

**Phase 3 (Inevitable):** Human describes need, AI handles everything, goods arrive.

When we reach Phase 3, the retailer's relationship isn't with me at all. It's with my AI agent. And that changes everything about how commerce works.

### The Commission Question

Major e-commerce platforms already pay affiliates 1-10% for referred sales. If an AI agent is making purchasing decisions for millions of users, that referral fee represents a substantial revenue stream – one that could fund the AI service itself.

Today, I use Claude to research a £746 laptop. Tomorrow, Claude might execute that purchase on my behalf. At that point, why wouldn't the affiliate commission flow to the intermediary that made the transaction happen?

The retailers who grasp this early will be building APIs for AI purchasing agents, negotiating commission structures with AI providers, and optimising their data feeds for machine consumption. The ones who don't will find themselves paying fees to intermediaries they never saw coming.

### The Loyalty Points Problem

Here's where it gets properly interesting. Loyalty programmes are designed to influence human behaviour – to create switching costs, to reward repeat custom, to build emotional attachment to a brand.

None of that works on an AI.

My AI agent won't be swayed by "You're only 500 points from a free flight." It won't feel the sunk-cost pull of an accumulated balance. It won't experience the dopamine hit of watching points tick upward. It will simply calculate: does this retailer offer the best combination of price, availability, and reliability for this transaction?

But loyalty points have monetary value. And an AI agent optimising on my behalf would be foolish to ignore them.

Consider a future where my AI:

- **Aggregates my loyalty accounts** – tracking balances across dozens of programmes I've half-forgotten
- **Factors points into purchasing decisions** – "Retailer A is £20 cheaper, but Retailer B gives you 2,000 points worth £25 in future value"
- **Optimises point accumulation** – routing purchases to maximise earning rates across categories
- **Redeems strategically** – burning points when their value peaks or before they expire
- **Negotiates on my behalf** – "My client has £500 in unredeemed points with your competitor; what can you offer to switch?"

Suddenly, loyalty programmes become a data problem, not a psychology problem. The winner isn't the retailer with the most compelling emotional proposition – it's the one whose points offer genuine, calculable value.

### Or Perhaps the AI Keeps the Points

Here's the truly disruptive thought. If my AI agent is facilitating transactions, negotiating with retailers, and driving purchasing decisions, perhaps the loyalty points should accrue to *it*, not to me.

Think about it:
- The AI did the research
- The AI found the best deal
- The AI executed the transaction
- The AI maintained the supplier relationships

The commission and the loyalty rewards are compensation for that work. If I'm not doing the work, why should I receive the compensation?

This sounds absurd until you realise it's simply the affiliate model applied to AI agents. The agent builds relationships with preferred suppliers. The suppliers reward the agent for directing business their way. The agent uses those rewards to fund better service for its users.

The user gets convenience and good outcomes. The retailer gets transactions. The AI gets the margin.

### What Retailers Should Do Now

If this trajectory is correct – and I believe it is – retailers have perhaps twelve to eighteen months to adapt. The priorities:

1. **Structured product data** – machines can't parse your beautiful product photography; they need clean, complete, accurate specifications in formats they can consume

2. **API-first commerce** – your website is for humans; your API is for AI agents; the API will matter more

3. **Transparent pricing** – AI agents will find the cheapest supplier instantly; opacity becomes a disadvantage, not a protection

4. **Reliability metrics** – delivery accuracy, stock accuracy, returns handling – these become your competitive moat when price is transparent

5. **Agent commission structures** – decide now whether you'll pay AI intermediaries for transactions, or watch them route business elsewhere

6. **Loyalty programme redesign** – points systems built for human psychology will fail; value-based programmes that survive algorithmic scrutiny will win

The retailers who treat this as a distant hypothetical will be the Kodaks of commerce. The ones who start building for machine customers today will own the next decade.

## Conclusion

I haven't made the purchase yet. But when I do, the retailer will see a transaction appear with no preceding engagement. No warming up. No nurturing. Just a specification, a price, and a delivery address.

This is the new reality. The research happens elsewhere. The decision happens elsewhere. The retailer is simply the fulfilment layer at the end.

Those who understand this shift will adapt their systems accordingly – making their data available, their prices competitive, their stock accurate. Those who don't will wonder why their carefully crafted customer journeys show ever-decreasing traffic while their competitors seem to win orders from nowhere.

The buyer was always there. They just became invisible.

And soon, even the final click won't be theirs to see.
