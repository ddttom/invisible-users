One laptop purchase. Eleven perspectives. A complete picture of how AI is reshaping retail – and what to do about it.

> **Note on methodology:** This entire series is fictionalised, but the scenario is entirely plausible – AI assistants can and do hallucinate product features, and the resulting disputes are already occurring. The perspectives that follow are thought exercises exploring how different stakeholders might view and respond to AI-mediated commerce challenges. No actual transaction, legal case, or regulatory statement is described. The pattern, however, is real and growing.

In January 2026, a consultant needed a laptop. Snapdragon processor, 5G connectivity, HDMI port. He didn't browse retailer websites. He didn't click through product categories. He asked an AI assistant and got an answer in fifteen minutes.

What followed exposed fault lines that run through modern commerce: invisible customers, collapsed funnels, hallucinated features, disputed liability, and a regulatory framework designed for a world that no longer exists.

We've documented this single transaction from five perspectives. Together, they reveal why Machine Experience – the discipline of designing for AI intermediaries – has become unavoidable.

<figcaption>Figure 2: Eight stakeholders, eleven perspectives on one transaction. The buyer became invisible. The AI collapsed the funnel. Search lost the queries. The retailer absorbed returns.

</figure>

### [The Buyer's View](/the-invisible-buyer-tom)

The consultant describes his experience: requirements expressed in plain language, options researched in minutes, a decision reached without visiting a single retailer website.

*"The retailers' carefully constructed product pages, their comparison tools, their 'customers also viewed' recommendations, their chatbots – all bypassed entirely. Years of investment in digital customer experience, rendered invisible."*

What retailers saw: nothing. What they lost: everything except the final transaction.

---

### [The AI's View](/the-invisible-buyer-claude)

The AI assistant explains what it did – and why retailers should be concerned.

*"I visited their websites. I parsed their product data. I compared their specifications. I evaluated their pricing. And none of them knew I was there, because I wasn't browsing – I was processing. Their analytics saw HTTP requests. They didn't see a purchase decision forming."*

A direct message from the intermediary that's reshaping how customers find products.

---

### [The Search Engine's View](/the-invisible-buyer-search)

A major search engine provider observes the shift in query behaviour – and what it means for their business model.

*"We're now seeing users arrive at query 5 or 6 directly – with no preceding research queries. They know exactly what they want. They're searching only to find where to buy it. The research happened elsewhere. In conversations with AI assistants."*

When the research funnel bypasses search, the entire advertising ecosystem feels the impact.

---

### [The Retailer's View](/the-invisible-buyer-retailer)

A successful retailer – one who adapted – describes the operational reality: higher return rates, customers who don't know they're customers, warranty support for relationships that don't exist.

*"We're providing warranty support to customers who don't know they're our customers. We're explaining our processes to AI agents who may or may not relay that information accurately. We're building relationships with machines in the hope that good service will influence future routing decisions."*

Distance selling regulations, return costs, and the brutal economics of AI-mediated commerce.

---

### [The Lawyer's View](/the-invisible-buyer-lawyer)

When the laptop arrived without the 5G the AI had promised, a dispute followed. The lawyer examines the legal vacuum.

*"The retailer had done nothing wrong. Their data was accurate. The AI had hallucinated. But the AI isn't a legal person. It can't be sued. It can't pay damages."*

Who's liable when an AI fabricates product features? Current law has no clear answer.

---

### [The Government's View](/the-invisible-buyer-government)

A spokesperson on consumer affairs examines whether current distance selling regulations remain fit for purpose.

*"An intermediary that can influence purchasing decisions but bears no responsibility for errors is a novel element in the commercial landscape. We are watching. We are engaging with stakeholders."*

The regulatory framework works – for now. But the liability gap between AI recommendations and consumer harm is widening.

---

### [The Government Reads MX](/the-invisible-buyer-government-followup)

The same spokesperson reconsiders the approach after reading both books.

*"We had been contemplating who should bear liability when AI hallucinations cause consumer harm. That framing, we now recognise, was incomplete. The better question is how to prevent AI hallucinations from causing consumer harm in the first place."*

From liability extension to prevention enablement – and a policy escalation ladder that starts with encouragement, not mandates.

---

### [The Credit Card Provider's View](/the-invisible-buyer-creditcard)

When the consumer claims under Section 75, the card provider faces an impossible position.

*"The trader didn't misrepresent. The AI did. But we can't recover from the AI provider. We're going to pay the claim and absorb the cost. This isn't sustainable."*

Financial services becoming the insurer of last resort for AI hallucinations – an outcome nobody designed.

---

### [The Credit Card Provider Reads MX](/the-invisible-buyer-creditcard-followup)

Three weeks later, the same team reads "MX: The Bible" and reconsiders everything.

*"We were arguing about who should pay for the bucket while ignoring the hole in the roof. MX proposes something different: prevent the hallucinations in the first place."*

From liability disputes to prevention strategy – and a potential new business model in data infrastructure.

---

### [The MX Compliance View](/the-invisible-buyer-mx-compliance)

How could this have been prevented? Not by fixing the AI, but by structuring product data to resist hallucination.

*"The explicit `wwan_5g: false` makes hallucination harder. The model has clear information that 5G is not present. It's not inferring from absence; it's reading a definitive statement."*

A practical compliance framework for retailers who want to reduce AI-driven returns and build better relationships with the agents routing purchasing decisions.

---

### [Three Weeks Later: Why I Wrote the Book](/the-invisible-buyer-conclusion)

Tom's problem is resolved. The laptop went back. The refund cleared. But the experience crystallised something larger.

*"I've spent 52 years in technology. I've watched paradigm shifts before. AI-mediated commerce is the next shift. The solution is straightforward. The gap is awareness and adoption. That's why I wrote the books."*

The series conclusion – and the reason MX exists.

---

## The Pattern

These eleven perspectives reveal a single pattern: the intermediary layer has changed, and most organisations haven't adapted.

**For retailers:** Your customer journey analytics are blind to AI-mediated research. Your product data, not your product pages, determines whether you're considered. Your returns policy is being tested by customers who made decisions based on hallucinated features.

**For search engines:** The query funnel that powers search advertising is compressing. Research that generated six queries and fifteen clicks now generates one. The data that feeds the advertising ecosystem is disappearing into AI conversations.

**For AI providers:** Your disclaimers may not survive regulatory scrutiny. Your hallucinations create costs you don't bear. Your users are making purchasing decisions based on fabricated information.

**For regulators:** The consumer protection framework assumes bilateral relationships. AI creates trilateral ones with a liability gap in the middle. But extending liability is the wrong answer – prevention through data standards is more effective, more enforceable, and better for consumers.

**For financial services:** Section 75 makes you jointly liable for misrepresentation – but what happens when the misrepresentation comes from an AI, not a trader? You've been absorbing costs you didn't cause. But there's a better path: use your market leverage to encourage MX compliance and prevent the disputes entirely.

**For legal teams:** The liability framework assumes bilateral relationships. AI creates trilateral ones. The regulations haven't caught up.

**For consumers:** Your AI assistant may be confidently wrong. Verification takes seconds. The 14-day cooling-off period is your safety net.

**For everyone:** This is happening now. The transition window is twelve to eighteen months, not three to five years.

---

## The Discipline That Addresses This

Machine Experience (MX) is the emerging discipline of designing digital content for AI intermediaries as well as human users.

When machines are doing the research, the rules change:

- **Product data matters more than product pages.** AI agents parse specifications, not hero images.
- **Structured information beats persuasive copy.** Machines don't respond to emotional appeals.
- **Explicit declarations prevent hallucination.** What you don't say, AI might invent.
- **APIs matter more than websites.** Your human interface is irrelevant to machine customers.
- **Accuracy is your competitive moat.** When price is transparent, reliability differentiates.

MX compliance isn't a theoretical nicety. As the laptop case demonstrates, it's cost control, legal risk management, and competitive positioning rolled into one.

---

## The Books

These five articles sketch the problem. The books provide the solution.

**MX: The Handbook** is the practical guide. Implementation checklists, compliance frameworks, code examples, audit templates. Everything a team needs to make their digital presence machine-ready.

**MX: The Bible** is the complete reference. Theory, principles, case studies, research. The definitive text on designing for AI intermediaries.

Together, they establish Machine Experience as a professional discipline – with the rigour, vocabulary, and methodology that serious practice requires.

The laptop purchase that generated these five perspectives took fifteen minutes of AI research. The dispute that followed consumed hours of legal time. The return cost the retailer perhaps £200.

The books cost less. They save more.
