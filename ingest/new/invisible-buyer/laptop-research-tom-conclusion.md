# The Invisible Buyer: Three Weeks Later

*Tom Brennan, founder of the Machine Experience community*

> **Note:** This series is fictionalised, but the scenario is entirely plausible – and versions of it are already happening. AI assistants can and do hallucinate product features. The stakeholder responses explored here represent realistic perspectives on a problem that will only grow as AI-mediated commerce expands. The specific transaction is illustrative; the systemic challenge is real.

The laptop went back. The refund cleared. The 14-day cancellation right worked exactly as designed.

In the end, nobody was liable because nobody needed to be. I returned a product that didn't meet my needs. The retailer processed the return. My credit card statement shows the reversal. Case closed.

But here's what stayed with me: the system only worked because I knew my rights and acted quickly. The laptop arrived on day 3. I tested it on day 4. I initiated the return on day 5. I was back to square one by day 10.

What if I'd been busy? What if I'd assumed 5G was there but just needed configuring? What if I'd passed day 14 before realising the AI had hallucinated?

Then I'd have been fighting. Section 75 claims. Chargeback disputes. Consumer Rights Act arguments about goods matching their description. The retailer would have defended themselves – correctly – by pointing to their accurate specification. I'd have been stuck with a laptop that didn't do what I bought it to do, or embroiled in months of dispute resolution.

All because an AI made something up.

## What I Learned From Nine Other Perspectives

Writing this series, I explored how every stakeholder sees the same transaction. The exercise was clarifying.

**The AI** collapsed my research into fifteen minutes and delivered a confident recommendation. It didn't know it was wrong. It couldn't know – the data it consumed didn't explicitly state what the laptop lacked.

**The search engine** never saw my research queries. Their entire business model depends on observing the purchase funnel. I bypassed it completely.

**The retailer** did everything right. Accurate listing. Clear specification. Good price. They still would have eaten a return if I'd been slower, or dealt with a dispute if I'd been stubborn.

**The lawyer** found no clear liability path. The retailer didn't misrepresent. The AI isn't a legal person. I made a decision based on fabricated information, and nobody was responsible for the fabrication.

**The government** recognised the gap but had no immediate remedy. Their consumer protection framework assumes traders cause the problems. It doesn't account for AI intermediaries that introduce errors independently.

**The credit card provider** would have declined my Section 75 claim – correctly – because the retailer made no misrepresentation. They'd have absorbed investigation costs regardless. They're tracking a growing category of disputes with no recovery path.

Every stakeholder is dealing with a problem they didn't create and can't solve individually.

## What Changed When They Read MX

The interesting thing: both the government spokesperson and the credit card provider published follow-ups after reading "MX: The Bible."

Their thinking shifted. Both had been focused on liability – who should pay when AI gets it wrong. Both recognised that's the wrong question.

The right question is: how do we stop AI getting it wrong?

The answer is in the data. If the retailer's product specification had included `wwan_5g: false`, the AI couldn't have hallucinated 5G capability. Explicit negatives block fabrication. Structured data prevents misinterpretation. Machine-readable specifications give AI systems facts instead of gaps to fill with guesses.

The government is now developing voluntary codes and considering procurement requirements. The credit card provider is exploring compliance-based pricing and data infrastructure partnerships. Both see prevention as more effective than remediation.

They arrived at the same conclusion I did. They just needed a framework to show them the path.

## Why I Wrote the Books

I've spent 52 years in technology. I've watched paradigm shifts before. The move from mainframes to PCs. The emergence of the web. Mobile. Cloud. Each transition created winners and losers, and the difference was usually preparation.

AI-mediated commerce is the next shift. It's already happening. The purchase funnel is collapsing. Research is moving into conversations. Retailers are becoming invisible to their own customers. And the infrastructure – the data layer that connects products to AI understanding – isn't ready.

My laptop was a £746 inconvenience resolved in ten days. Multiply that by millions of transactions. Multiply it by higher stakes – medical devices, financial products, safety equipment. Multiply it by consumers who don't know their rights, who miss the 14-day window, who can't afford to fight.

The scale of potential harm is significant. The solution is straightforward. The gap is awareness and adoption.

That's why I wrote "MX: The Handbook" and "MX: The Bible."

**The Handbook** is practical. It's for the product manager who needs to understand what's coming, the developer who needs to implement structured data, the content strategist who needs to audit existing specifications. It's the "what to do Monday morning" guide.

**The Bible** is deeper. It's the theory, the principles, the framework for thinking about machine experience as a discipline. It's for the strategist, the architect, the leader who needs to understand not just what to do but why it matters and how it connects to everything else.

Together, they're the documentation for a transition that's already underway.

## The Offer

I'm not neutral here. I wrote the books. I founded the Machine Experience community. I have a commercial interest in MX adoption.

But I also have 52 years of watching what happens when industries don't prepare for technological shifts. The organisations that adapted early to web commerce thrived. The ones that dismissed it as a fad, or waited for someone else to figure it out, struggled or disappeared.

AI-mediated commerce is the same kind of shift. The data layer is the new storefront. Structured specifications are the new shop window. Explicit declarations are the new sales conversation.

The retailers who prepare will be recommended. The ones who don't will be invisible – or worse, misrepresented.

The regulators who understand prevention will create frameworks that work. The ones who focus on liability will create bureaucracy that helps nobody.

The financial services providers who see data infrastructure as opportunity will build new business models. The ones who see AI disputes as cost to minimise will keep writing cheques for problems they didn't cause.

The choice is preparation or reaction. The books provide the preparation.

## What Happens Next

On 2nd April 2026, both books launch. The framework will be public. The practices will be documented. The path will be clear.

Between now and then, the Machine Experience community is growing. Practitioners sharing implementations. Retailers comparing results. AI providers discussing data requirements. The conversation is happening.

I'll keep writing about what I see. More case studies. More stakeholder perspectives. More examples of what works and what doesn't.

The invisible buyer isn't going away. AI-mediated commerce will only grow. The question isn't whether to adapt – it's how quickly.

I nearly bought a laptop without 5G because an AI made something up. I got lucky. The next person might not.

That's why I wrote the book.
