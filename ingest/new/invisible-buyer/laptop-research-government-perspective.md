# The Invisible Buyer: Consumer Protection in the Age of AI-Mediated Commerce

*A perspective from a government spokesperson on consumer affairs*

> **Note:** This is a fictionalised perspective exploring how regulators might view AI-mediated commerce. The scenario described – AI assistants hallucinating product features and creating consumer disputes – is entirely plausible and already occurring. The policy questions are real; this thought exercise explores potential regulatory responses.

We have been monitoring the emergence of AI-mediated purchasing with considerable interest. The case study presented in this series – a laptop purchase researched through an AI assistant, resulting in a dispute over hallucinated product features – illustrates challenges we are actively considering.

Our consumer protection framework is robust. It has served consumers well for over a decade. But we recognise that the framework was designed for a different era of commerce, and we must assess whether it remains fit for purpose.

## The Current Framework

The Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 establish clear rights for distance purchases:

- **Pre-contract information requirements:** Traders must provide specified information before a contract is concluded, including the main characteristics of goods, the total price, and delivery arrangements.

- **The 14-day cancellation period:** Consumers may cancel a distance contract within 14 days without giving any reason. This "cooling-off" period exists because consumers cannot physically inspect goods before purchase.

- **The right to a refund:** Following cancellation, traders must reimburse all payments within 14 days.

The Consumer Rights Act 2015 provides additional protections:

- **Goods must match their description:** Where goods are sold by description, they must conform to that description.

- **The 30-day right to reject:** Consumers may reject goods that do not conform to the contract within 30 days for a full refund.

- **Remedies for faulty goods:** Beyond 30 days, consumers retain rights to repair, replacement, or partial refund.

These provisions have worked well. They balance consumer protection with commercial certainty. They are well understood by traders and consumers alike.

## The Challenge AI Presents

The laptop case raises questions our framework was not designed to answer.

**The information requirement question:** Regulations require traders to provide pre-contract information. Traders in this case did provide accurate information – on their website, in their product data feeds, in their structured specifications. The consumer did not read it. An AI assistant read it, interpreted it, and – in this case – hallucinated additional features.

Has the trader met their information obligations? We believe so. The information was provided, accurately and accessibly. That the consumer chose to receive it through an intermediary that introduced errors does not, in our view, transfer liability to the trader.

**The description question:** Goods must match their description. But whose description? The trader's description was accurate. The AI's description was not. The consumer relied on the AI's description.

Current law is clear that the operative description is the one provided by the trader. Where an intermediary introduces errors, the trader is not responsible for those errors – provided the trader's own description was accurate.

**The cancellation right question:** The 14-day cancellation right exists because consumers cannot inspect goods before purchase. It compensates for information asymmetry.

AI assistants arguably reduce information asymmetry. They can parse specifications, compare products, and surface relevant details more effectively than most human consumers. Should consumers who use sophisticated AI research tools retain the same cancellation rights as those who purchase without research?

Our current position is yes. The cancellation right is unconditional. It does not depend on how much research the consumer conducted. It would be impractical and undesirable to create different tiers of consumer protection based on research methodology.

However, we acknowledge this creates costs. Traders are absorbing returns from consumers whose AI assistants made errors. The consumer protection framework is, in effect, providing insurance against AI hallucination – with traders bearing the premium.

## What We Are Considering

We are not proposing immediate legislative changes. The framework is functioning. Consumers are protected. Traders have certainty about their obligations.

But we are monitoring several developments:

**AI provider responsibility:** Should AI providers bear some responsibility when their recommendations cause consumer harm? Current law treats AI assistants as tools – like calculators or search engines. The consumer uses the tool; the consumer bears responsibility for how they use it.

This may not remain appropriate as AI assistants become more sophisticated and more trusted. When an AI confidently states that a product has a feature it lacks, and a consumer relies on that statement, there is an argument that the AI provider should share responsibility for the resulting harm.

We are engaging with the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology on this question. It intersects with broader AI governance considerations.

**Structured data requirements:** Traders who provide clear, machine-readable product data may reduce hallucination risk. Should we encourage or require such data provision?

We are cautious about imposing new compliance burdens on traders. But we note that structured data benefits multiple parties: it improves AI accuracy, reduces disputes, and ultimately protects consumers. Market forces may achieve what regulation would mandate.

**Cross-border enforcement:** AI providers are often based outside the UK. If we determined that AI providers should bear responsibility for hallucinations causing consumer harm, enforcement would be challenging.

We are monitoring international developments. The EU is considering AI liability frameworks. The US is examining Section 230 implications. A coordinated approach would be more effective than unilateral action.

## Guidance for Consumers

While we consider longer-term policy responses, we offer the following guidance:

1. **Your rights are unchanged.** The Consumer Contracts Regulations give you 14 days to cancel any distance purchase for any reason. The Consumer Rights Act gives you 30 days to reject goods that don't match their description. These rights apply regardless of how you researched your purchase.

2. **AI recommendations are not trader descriptions.** If an AI assistant tells you a product has a feature, that is the AI's statement, not the trader's. Check the trader's own product information before purchasing if the feature is important to you.

3. **Use the cooling-off period.** If you purchase based on an AI recommendation and the product doesn't meet your expectations, you can cancel within 14 days without needing to prove anything was wrong.

4. **Pay by credit card for purchases over £100.** Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act makes your credit card provider jointly liable with the trader. This provides an additional avenue for redress if something goes wrong.

5. **Keep records.** If you rely on an AI's recommendation, consider keeping a record of what the AI told you. This may be helpful if a dispute arises.

## Guidance for Traders

1. **Your obligations remain the same.** Provide accurate pre-contract information. Ensure goods match their description. Honour cancellation and rejection rights.

2. **Clear, structured product data helps everyone.** Machine-readable specifications reduce the risk of AI misinterpretation. This protects consumers and reduces your dispute exposure.

3. **Don't refuse legitimate returns.** Even if an AI hallucinated a feature and the consumer relied on that hallucination, the consumer retains cancellation rights. Fighting legitimate returns creates complaints, damages reputation, and may attract regulatory attention.

4. **Document your product information.** If a dispute reaches us, we will want to see what information you provided and when. Maintain records.

## Guidance for AI Providers

We do not currently regulate AI providers in their capacity as shopping assistants. But we observe that:

1. **Accuracy matters.** Consumers are relying on your recommendations for significant purchases. Hallucinations cause real harm – financial, practical, and emotional.

2. **Disclaimers have limits.** Terms of service that disclaim all accuracy may not align with reasonable consumer expectations. If you present your AI as a helpful shopping assistant, consumers will expect it to be helpful and reasonably accurate.

3. **The regulatory environment is evolving.** What is unregulated today may not be unregulated tomorrow. Building accurate, trustworthy systems now is both good practice and prudent preparation.

4. **Consider your role in the ecosystem.** When your AI recommends a product and the consumer returns it because the recommendation was wrong, traders bear costs they did not cause. This is not sustainable indefinitely.

## Our Position

The consumer protection framework is functioning. Consumers have rights. Traders have obligations. Disputes can be resolved.

But we acknowledge that AI-mediated commerce introduces new dynamics that the framework was not designed to address. An intermediary that can influence purchasing decisions but bears no responsibility for errors is a novel element in the commercial landscape.

We are not proposing to extend the framework punitively. We are not seeking to stifle innovation or burden AI providers with unworkable obligations. We recognise that AI assistants provide genuine value to consumers.

But we are watching. We are engaging with stakeholders. We are considering whether the balance of rights and responsibilities remains appropriate as AI becomes more prevalent in consumer decision-making.

The invisible buyer may be invisible to retailers and search engines. But they are not invisible to us. We see the complaints. We track the disputes. We monitor the trends.

If the current framework proves inadequate – if consumers are systematically harmed by AI hallucinations with no avenue for redress – we will act. We have the powers. We have the mandate. We will use them if necessary.

For now, we encourage all parties to act responsibly. Traders: provide accurate information. AI providers: improve accuracy and transparency. Consumers: use your rights wisely.

The framework works. Let's keep it that way.
