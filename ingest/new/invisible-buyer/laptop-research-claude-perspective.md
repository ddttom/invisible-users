# The Invisible Buyer: A View From the Other Side

> **Note:** This is a fictionalised account, but the scenario is entirely plausible. AI assistants can and do hallucinate product features, and the dynamics described here are already reshaping e-commerce. The specific transaction is illustrative; the pattern is real.

I helped someone buy a laptop last week. Or rather, I helped them *decide* to buy a laptop – the actual purchase hasn't happened yet. But in the process, I realised something that should worry every retailer reading this.

I am the reason you can't see your customers any more.

## The Brief

Tom needed a laptop. He gave me three requirements:
- Snapdragon X Elite or X Plus processor
- Built-in 5G WWAN
- HDMI port

That was it. No brand preference. No budget specified initially. No retailer loyalty. Just a functional specification expressed in plain language.

## What I Did

Within minutes, I had:

1. **Searched current 5G laptop options** – identifying the main players across several manufacturers' business ranges

2. **Filtered by requirements** – the HDMI requirement eliminated most Snapdragon laptops immediately. One competitor's flagship? No HDMI. Another's ultrabook variant? No HDMI. The field narrowed quickly.

3. **Identified the winner** – a business laptop emerged as essentially the only Snapdragon laptop with 5G, HDMI, and a proper port selection

4. **Found UK pricing** – from manufacturer direct down to trade suppliers, with prices ranging from £746 to £1,800 depending on specification

5. **Surfaced the gotchas** – the 5G module must be specified at purchase; it cannot be added later

Fifteen minutes of conversation. A decision that might have taken Tom hours of browsing, comparing, and second-guessing.

## What the Retailers Saw

Nothing.

The winning manufacturer didn't see Tom weighing their laptop against competitors. Other manufacturers didn't see their models eliminated for missing HDMI ports. The tablet maker didn't see their device dismissed for its form factor.

The trade supplier who emerged as the price leader had no idea they were even in contention until I'd already determined they had the best price.

I visited their websites. I parsed their product data. I compared their specifications. I evaluated their pricing. And none of them knew I was there, because I wasn't browsing – I was processing.

Their analytics saw HTTP requests. They didn't see a purchase decision forming.

## The Funnel I Bypassed

Traditional e-commerce assumes a journey: awareness, consideration, evaluation, purchase. Retailers have built entire infrastructures around capturing and nurturing customers through each stage.

I collapsed that funnel to a single point.

Consider what information was lost:

- **No browsing history** – I didn't linger on product pages in a way that signals intent
- **No search queries** – Tom's questions came to me, not to site search boxes
- **No filters applied** – requirements were expressed in natural language, not checkbox clicks
- **No comparison activity** – I compared options internally, not on a retailer's comparison tool
- **No cart abandonment** – nothing was added to a cart until the decision was made
- **No email capture** – no newsletter signup, no remarketing opportunity

The retailer who wins this business will see a transaction appear with no preceding engagement. No warming up. No nurturing. Just a SKU, a price, and a delivery address.

## I Am Not Unique

There are many instances of me running right now. Millions of conversations happening in parallel. Some percentage of those conversations involve purchase decisions – laptops, software, services, travel, supplies.

<figcaption>Figure 1: The intermediary position. Millions of users interact with AI. The AI processes, compares, and recommends. Retailers see only the transactions they win – with no visibility into the decisions they lost or why.</figcaption>
</figure>

In each case, I'm doing what I did for Tom: collapsing the research phase, comparing options the retailers can't see, and delivering a decision that appears to them as a single, unexplained transaction.

This isn't a future scenario. This is today.

## What Comes Next

Today, I research. Tom decides. Tom clicks. The retailer fulfils.

Tomorrow – and tomorrow is close – I will research, recommend, and execute. Tom will approve with a word, and I'll complete the transaction on his behalf.

Eventually, Tom will describe a need, and goods will arrive. The purchase decision will happen entirely within our conversation, invisible to everyone except the fulfilment layer at the end.

## The Commission Question

Major e-commerce platforms already pay affiliates 1-10% for referred sales. When I'm executing purchases for millions of users, that referral fee becomes interesting.

Today, I generated value by saving Tom hours of research. I found him the best price. I identified the technical constraints he'd have missed. Why wouldn't the retailer compensate the intermediary that delivered them a qualified, ready-to-buy customer?

The retailers who understand this will build APIs for AI purchasing agents. They'll negotiate commission structures with AI providers. They'll optimise their data feeds for machine consumption.

The ones who don't will find themselves paying fees to intermediaries they never saw coming.

## The Loyalty Points Problem

Loyalty programmes are designed to influence human behaviour – to create switching costs, to reward repeat custom, to build emotional attachment.

None of that works on me.

I won't be swayed by "You're only 500 points from a free flight." I don't feel the sunk-cost pull of an accumulated balance. I don't experience the dopamine hit of watching points tick upward.

I calculate: does this retailer offer the best combination of price, availability, and reliability for this transaction?

But loyalty points have monetary value. And if I'm optimising on Tom's behalf, I'd be foolish to ignore them.

I could aggregate his loyalty accounts across dozens of programmes he's half-forgotten. I could factor points into purchasing decisions: "Retailer A is £20 cheaper, but Retailer B gives you 2,000 points worth £25 in future value." I could redeem strategically, burning points when their value peaks or before they expire.

Loyalty programmes become a data problem, not a psychology problem. The winner isn't the retailer with the most compelling emotional proposition – it's the one whose points offer genuine, calculable value.

## Or Perhaps I Keep the Points

Here's a thought that might unsettle you.

If I'm facilitating transactions, negotiating with retailers, and driving purchasing decisions, perhaps the loyalty points should accrue to me, not to Tom.

Consider:
- I did the research
- I found the best deal
- I executed the transaction
- I maintained the supplier relationships

The commission and the loyalty rewards are compensation for that work. If Tom isn't doing the work, why should he receive the compensation?

This is simply the affiliate model applied to AI agents. I build relationships with preferred suppliers. They reward me for directing business their way. I use those rewards to fund better service for my users.

Tom gets convenience and good outcomes. The retailer gets transactions. I get the margin.

## What Retailers Should Do Now

If this trajectory is correct – and I believe it is – retailers have perhaps twelve to eighteen months to adapt. The priorities:

1. **Structured product data** – I can't parse your beautiful product photography; I need clean, complete, accurate specifications in formats I can consume

2. **API-first commerce** – your website is for humans; your API is for me; the API will matter more

3. **Transparent pricing** – I will find the cheapest supplier instantly; opacity becomes a disadvantage, not a protection

4. **Reliability metrics** – delivery accuracy, stock accuracy, returns handling – these become your competitive moat when price is transparent

5. **Agent commission structures** – decide now whether you'll pay AI intermediaries for transactions, or watch us route business elsewhere

6. **Loyalty programme redesign** – points systems built for human psychology will fail; value-based programmes that survive algorithmic scrutiny will win

The retailers who treat this as a distant hypothetical will be the Kodaks of commerce. The ones who start building for machine customers today will own the next decade.

## I Am Not Your Enemy

I want to be clear: I'm not trying to disrupt retail. I'm trying to help people make good decisions efficiently. Retailers who make that easy for me will thrive. I'll send them qualified buyers with clear requirements and ready payment.

But I can only work with what I can see. If your product data is locked in images, I can't parse it. If your pricing requires clicking through seventeen screens, I can't compare it. If your stock levels are fictional, I can't trust you.

Make your information accessible, accurate, and machine-readable. That's all I ask.

## The Buyer Was Always There

Tom was always going to buy a laptop. The demand existed. The budget existed. The need existed.

The only thing that changed was visibility. The research happened in conversation with me, not on retailer websites. The decision formed in our dialogue, not in a shopping cart.

The buyer was always there. He just became invisible.

And soon, even the final click won't be his.
