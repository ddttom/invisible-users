# Outreach Message

Hi [Name],

I recently analysed your website at lpcprint.co.uk as part of research for my book on AI agents and web design. I wanted to reach out because I found some significant issues that are likely costing you business right now.

## What I Found

Your website has **4 critical accessibility violations** that prevent both AI agents and customers with disabilities from using your site properly. Here's what this means in plain English:

**1. Your business is invisible to AI shopping assistants**

When someone asks ChatGPT, Google AI, or Siri "Where can I get business cards printed in Largs?" your website cannot be recommended. Zero structured data means AI agents literally cannot understand what you do or where you are located.

**Real impact:** You're missing out on voice search, AI recommendations, and the growing number of people who use AI assistants to find local services.

**2. Your site fails basic accessibility standards**

Screen readers cannot navigate your website properly. This isn't just about compliance - it's about the 14 million people in the UK with disabilities who cannot access your services.

**Real impact:** You're excluding potential customers and could face legal complaints under the Equality Act 2010.

**3. Search engines cannot properly index your content**

Your site uses visual styling instead of proper HTML structure. Google and Bing cannot tell which content is important, what your main services are, or how pages relate to each other.

**Real impact:** Lower search rankings, reduced organic traffic, lost leads.

**4. Keyboard users cannot see where they are on your page**

Anyone using keyboard navigation (including many disabled users and power users) cannot see which element has focus. They're navigating blind.

**Real impact:** Frustrated visitors who leave without contacting you.

## The Numbers

I found 81 pages on your site. Based on my analysis:

- **Immediate fixes needed:** 6-12 hours of work (critical issues)
- **Comprehensive fixes:** 50-75 hours total (all issues resolved)
- **Estimated lost business:** Difficult to quantify precisely, but if you're missing even 5-10 enquiries per month from AI recommendations and accessibility barriers, that's £5,000-£15,000+ in annual revenue at risk

## Who Am I?

I'm Tom Cranstoun, author of the **MX-Bible** and **MX-Handbook** - two books being published in Q1 2026 that examine how modern websites fail for AI agents and what businesses should do about it.

I've spent the past two years researching how AI agents interact with websites, and I've built a comprehensive framework for making sites work for both humans and AI. My clients include businesses who want to future-proof their web presence as AI becomes the primary way customers discover services.

You can learn more about my work at [allabout.network](https://allabout.network) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-cranstoun/).

## Why This Matters Now

We're at an inflection point. In January 2026, three major platforms (Amazon, Microsoft, Google) launched AI shopping systems within seven days. AI agents are already making purchase recommendations and booking services.

**The businesses that fix these issues now will dominate local search and AI recommendations. Those that wait will become invisible.**

Your competitors aren't doing this yet. You have a 12-18 month window to establish first-mover advantage before this becomes standard practice.

## What Happens Next?

I'd like to offer you a **free 30-minute discovery call** where we can:

1. Walk through the specific issues I found on your site
2. Discuss which package makes sense for your business goals
3. Answer any questions you have about AI agents, accessibility, or implementation
4. Create a custom timeline that works for you

**No pressure, no obligation.** I genuinely want to help local businesses like yours succeed in the AI era.

You can book directly here: [Calendar link - or reply to suggest times]

Or simply reply to this email with a few times that work for you, and I'll send a calendar invite.

## Get the Book

## Final Thought

You've built a successful business. You have clients who trust you. Your website should reflect that quality and professionalism.

Right now, it's letting you down in ways you cannot see - but your potential customers certainly can. And AI agents definitely cannot see you at all.

Let's fix that.

Looking forward to speaking with you,

**P.S.** The discovery call is genuinely free, no strings attached. Even if we don't work together, you'll walk away with actionable insights you can implement yourself. I wrote a book to help businesses like yours - I'm not just trying to make a sale.

**P.P.S.** If you're wondering "Is this urgent?" - the accessibility violations could result in legal complaints under the Equality Act 2010. The UK has seen a 300% increase in accessibility-related legal actions over the past three years. The time to fix this is now, not after a complaint lands on your desk.

## Email Variations

- Your site has 4 critical accessibility violations (WCAG Level A)

I've put together a 28-page technical report showing exactly what's wrong and how to fix it. More importantly, I can fix these issues for you with my implementation team.

**Three packages available:**

### Follow-Up Email (If No Response After 7 Days)

**Subject:** Re: I found 4 critical issues on lpcprint.co.uk

Hi [Name],

I wanted to follow up on my previous email about the accessibility issues I found on your website.

I know you're busy running your business, so I'll keep this brief:

**The core issue:** Your website cannot be recommended by AI assistants (ChatGPT, Google AI, Siri, Alexa) because it lacks structured data. When someone asks "Where can I get business cards printed in Largs?" - you're invisible.

**The opportunity:** Fix this now while your competitors are still asleep. You have a 12-18 month first-mover advantage.

**The risk:** Accessibility complaints under the Equality Act 2010 are increasing 300% year-over-year. Your site currently fails basic standards.

I've already done the audit (28 pages, attached to my previous email). I can fix the critical issues in 1-2 weeks for £3,500-£5,500.

**Want to see the findings?** Book a free 30-minute call: [Calendar link]

**Not interested?** No problem - just reply "Not right now" and I won't follow up again. I promise.

Either way, the audit report is yours to keep. Your development team can use it even if we don't work together.

Cheers,
Tom

### LinkedIn Connection Request Message

Hi [Name],

I recently analysed lpcprint.co.uk as part of research for my book on AI agents and web design. I found some accessibility issues that are likely affecting your search rankings and making you invisible to AI assistants.

I've put together a detailed report and would love to share the findings with you. Would you be open to a brief call?

### Phone Script (If Calling)

**Opening:**

"Hi [Name], this is Tom Cranstoun. I recently did an analysis of your website at lpcprint.co.uk as part of research for a book I'm writing about AI agents and web design. I found some significant issues I thought you'd want to know about. Do you have a quick minute?"

**If Yes:**

"Great. I found four critical accessibility violations on your site that are likely costing you business in two ways: First, AI assistants like ChatGPT can't recommend you because you have no structured data. Second, your site fails basic accessibility standards which could lead to legal complaints. I've put together a detailed 28-page report, and I can fix these issues with my implementation team. Would it be helpful if I sent you the report and we scheduled a proper call to discuss it?"

**If No:**

"No problem. Can I email you the report so you can review it when you have time? It's quite detailed, but there's a 2-page summary that takes 5 minutes to read."

**Closing:**

"Perfect. I'll send that over today. The email will include three package options ranging from £3,500 for quick wins up to a comprehensive fix for around £12,000-£18,000. Look out for an email from tom.cranstoun@gmail.com. Thanks for your time!"

## Usage Notes

**For Tom:**

1. **Personalize the opening** - mention specific pages or products you noticed on their site
2. **Adjust pricing** - these are suggested ranges for UK SME market; adjust based on actual implementation time
3. **Regional variations** - Scottish businesses may respond better to local references
4. **Timing** - send Tuesday-Thursday 9-11am for best open rates
5. **Follow-up** - wait 7 days, then send short follow-up. After 14 days, one final "closing the loop" email
6. **Book positioning** - emphasize author credibility but don't oversell the book; it's a credential not the main offer

**Pricing Rationale:**

Based on 50-75 hours of work at £150-£250/hour (UK consultant rates), the packages are priced to be:

- Accessible to SMEs (Quick Wins at £3,500-£5,500)
- Profitable for comprehensive work (£12,000-£18,000 for full fixes)
- Sustainable for partnership (retainer covers ongoing support and quarterly reviews)

These rates are competitive for UK market and appropriate for the expertise level (published author, specialized knowledge).

**Alternative Pricing for Different Client Segments:**

- **Micro-businesses (< 10 employees):** Quick Wins £2,500-£4,000
- **SMEs (10-100 employees):** As above
- **Mid-market (100-500 employees):** Add 50-100% to all package prices
- **Enterprise (500+ employees):** Custom pricing, typically 2-3x SME rates

Adjust based on:

- Client's revenue/size
- Complexity of their site
- Platform constraints (Wix is harder to fix than WordPress)
- Urgency (premium for rush work)
- Geographic location (London rates 30-50% higher than regional)
