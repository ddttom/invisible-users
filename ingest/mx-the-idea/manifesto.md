  This is the foundational document for MX thinking. Present it as a
  paradigm shift, not a technical specification. The core argument:
  the web must become explicit to support trustworthy AI interaction.

# The MX Manifesto

## The Web Was Built for Eyes

For three decades, we've constructed the web around a single assumption: humans will read it.

We've optimised for visual scanning - headlines that catch attention, images that convey emotion, layouts that guide the eye. We've built for browsers that render, not programs that parse.

This made sense. Humans were the only meaningful audience.

That assumption is now false.

---

## The Invisible Audience

AI agents are visiting your website. Right now. They're not browsing - they're attempting to understand.

- Claude, parsing your product pages to answer a customer's question
- ChatGPT, trying to recommend services in your industry
- Perplexity, assembling facts about your organisation
- Copilot, helping someone complete a purchase
- Thousands of specialised agents you've never heard of

They arrive, they struggle, they leave. Most fail silently. No error logs. No analytics. No conversion.

You never knew they were there. You never knew you lost them.

These are the invisible users.

---

## The Comprehension Gap

When a human visits your website, they bring:

- **Visual processing:** Instant pattern recognition, layout comprehension
- **Context:** Cultural knowledge, industry understanding, common sense
- **Inference:** The ability to fill gaps, resolve ambiguity, understand intent

When an AI agent visits, it brings:

- **Text extraction:** The ability to read characters on a page
- **Pattern matching:** Recognition of common structures (maybe)
- **Uncertainty:** No reliable way to distinguish fact from presentation

The gap between these capabilities is vast. And we've built a web that assumes the first.

## The Hallucination Problem

When AI agents encounter ambiguous content, they don't stop. They guess.

- Is "£99" a price or a reference number? Guess.
- Is this text a product description or a review? Guess.
- Is this business open on Sundays? Guess.
- Are these two products related or alternatives? Guess.

Each guess is a potential hallucination. Each hallucination erodes trust.

Users ask AI assistants for recommendations. The AI, working from ambiguous data, fabricates details. The user discovers the error. Trust in AI decreases. Trust in your business decreases.

**Hallucination is not an AI problem. It's a data problem.**

When content is ambiguous, AI must infer. Inference produces errors. The solution isn't better AI - it's clearer content.

---

## The MX Proposition

Machine Experience (MX) is the discipline of making web content explicitly comprehensible to machines.

Not machine-only. Not at the expense of humans. But designed from the start to serve both audiences.

**The core principle:** What can be stated explicitly should never require inference.

- Don't let AI guess your price. State it in structured data.
- Don't let AI infer your hours. Declare them in Schema.org.
- Don't let AI deduce your product relationships. Define them explicitly.
- Don't let AI assume your content's status. Expose state in attributes.

Every inference eliminated is a hallucination prevented.

## The Three Transformations

MX compliance delivers three interconnected transformations:

### 1. From Hallucination to Accuracy

When data is explicit, AI doesn't guess. When AI doesn't guess, it doesn't hallucinate. When it doesn't hallucinate, users trust it. When users trust it, they act on its recommendations.

**Structured data is the foundation of trustworthy AI.**

### 2. From Isolation to Distribution

Most human knowledge is trapped in unstructured formats - prose, PDFs, images, videos. Accessible to humans who can consume these formats, inaccessible to systems that could distribute it globally.

MX-compliant content is machine-parseable. Machine-parseable content can be indexed, searched, synthesised, translated, and delivered by AI agents anywhere in the world.

**Explicit structure democratises knowledge access.**

### 3. From Waste to Efficiency

AI inference is computationally expensive. Every ambiguity requires processing cycles. Every inference consumes energy. At scale, this becomes environmentally significant.

When content is explicit, inference is unnecessary. Parsing explicit data is orders of magnitude more efficient than interpreting ambiguous content.

**Structured data reduces the energy cost of AI.**

---

## The Convergence Principle

Here's what makes MX remarkable: the same patterns that help AI agents also help humans with disabilities.

- **Semantic HTML** helps screen readers and AI parsers
- **Clear heading structure** aids navigation for both
- **Explicit state indicators** serve keyboard users and automated agents
- **Colour contrast requirements** improve readability for humans and extractability for machines

This is the convergence principle: optimising for machine comprehension simultaneously improves accessibility.

MX isn't a trade-off between human and machine experience. It's a convergence that improves both.

---

## The Standards

MX builds on established, open standards:

- **Schema.org:** Structured data vocabulary understood by all major platforms
- **Semantic HTML:** The foundational language of meaningful markup
- **ARIA:** Accessibility attributes that also serve machine comprehension
- **WAI-WCAG:** Guidelines that align with machine readability requirements

No proprietary formats. No platform lock-in. Open standards, universally applicable.

---

## The Moment

We are at an inflection point.

In January 2026, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google launched agent commerce systems within seven days of each other. AI-mediated purchasing moved from experiment to infrastructure.

The web is being rewritten. Content that AI can parse will be recommended, purchased, acted upon. Content that AI cannot parse will be invisible.

This isn't speculation. It's happening now.

---

## The Choice

Every website owner faces a choice:

**Option A:** Continue building for human eyes only. Hope AI agents figure it out. Accept invisibility in the emerging agent-mediated web.

**Option B:** Adopt MX compliance. Make content explicitly machine-readable. Appear in AI recommendations. Participate in agent commerce. Reduce hallucination about your organisation.

The patterns are straightforward:

1. Add Schema.org JSON-LD to every page
2. Use semantic HTML structure
3. Expose state with data-* attributes
4. Include MX meta tags

The investment is modest. The stakes are visibility in the next generation of the web.

## The Declaration

We declare that:

1. **The web must become explicit.** Implicit content served us for thirty years. The age of AI requires explicit structure.

2. **Hallucination is preventable.** When we provide clear data, AI doesn't need to guess. The responsibility for accuracy is shared between content creators and AI systems.

3. **Knowledge should be accessible.** Structured content enables global distribution of human knowledge through AI intermediaries.

4. **Efficiency matters.** The energy cost of AI inference at scale demands that we reduce unnecessary computation through explicit data.

5. **Human and machine experience converge.** The patterns that serve AI also serve accessibility. We don't choose between audiences - we serve both.

**This is MX. This is the future of the web. This is the idea.**
