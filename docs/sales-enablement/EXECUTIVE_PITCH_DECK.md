## Slide 2: The Problem

### We Are Facing a Silent Crisis

* **Fact:** By 2026, 20% of web traffic will be AI Agents acting on behalf of humans.
* **Reality:** Our website is built for human eyes (colors, layouts, animations).
* **The Gap:** AI Agents browse by code, not sight. They can't see "Green means Go."
* **The Result:** "Silent Conversion Failures." Agents try to buy, fail to parse our interface, and leave without a trace.

> "We are optimizing for the 80% of humans, and completely blocking the 20% of high-intent AI traffic."

## Slide 3: Evidence

### What Does a Failure Look Like?

(Insert screenshot of your checkout form)

* **Human Sees:** A red border around the "Email" field. We know to fix it.
* **AI Agent Sees:** `<input type="email" class="error-border">`
* **Why it Fails:** The agent doesn't download the CSS. It doesn't know `.error-border` means "Stop." It keeps clicking "Submit" and getting blocked.
* **Business Impact:** The agent assumes our site is broken and recommends a competitor.

## Slide 4: The Opportunity

### The First-Mover Advantage

* AI Agents **Learn**.
* If an agent succeeds on our site today, it "remembers" the path for next time.
* If it fails, it marks us as "unreliable."
* **The Window:** We have 12-18 months before this becomes a standard requirement.
* **Victory:** If we fix this now, we become the "Default Capability" for every shopping assistant (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.).

## Slide 5: The Solution

### "Agent-Ready" Architecture

We don't need a redesign. We need **Code Remediation**.

1. **Semantic HTML:** Replace `div` buttons with real `buttons`.
2. **Explicit State:** Add `data-state="success"` attributes so code explains itself.
3. **Structured Data:** Feed the robots the pricing/inventory data directly via `llms.txt`.

* **Impact on Human UX:** Zero visual change.
* **Impact on Accessibility:** Significantly improved (supports screen readers).

## Slide 6: ROI & Investment

### Turning Compliance into Growth

**Investment Required:**

* Audit Phase: £X,000 (2 weeks)
* Remediation Phase: £X,000 (Sprint 1-2)

**Projected Returns:**

* **Recovery:** Capture the estimated 5-10% of "Silent Failures" occurring now.
* **Discovery:** Rank #1 in AI Search results (Perplexity, SearchGPT).
* **Efficiency:** Reduce "How do I?" support tickets by making the site self-driving.

## Slide 7: Next Steps

### The Plan of Action

1. **Week 1:** Run the **Web Audit Suite** to benchmark our current score.
2. **Week 2:** Present the "Technical Debt" report with priority fixes.
3. **Month 1:** Fix the "Critical" blockers (Checkout, Pricing, Sign-up).

**Recommendation:** Approve the Phase 1 Audit budget of £[Amount] to quantify our risk.

## Slide 8: Appendix - Case Study

### Industry Example

* **Company:** Major Fashion Retailer
* **Action:** Exposed sizing data via Semantic HTML
* **Result:** 12% increase in automated cart additions.
* **Takeaway:** Small code changes drive significant revenue.
