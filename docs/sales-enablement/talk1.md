# The Invisible Users: Designing the Web for AI Agents and Everyone Else, talk

Websites can look polished, intuitive, and conversion-friendly, yet still fail quietly for a growing group of users. Not just people using assistive technologies, but also AI agents that are already browsing, comparing, and transacting on users’ behalf.

In this member call, Tom Cranstoun shares insights from his forthcoming book, The Invisible Users: Designing the Web for AI Agents and Everyone Else (due Q1 2026).

Drawing on real examples, Tom shows how design decisions that rely on visual feedback alone can lead to misunderstandings, failed tasks, and lost trust, without ever triggering an error message or analytics alert.

We’ll explore how different kinds of AI agents actually interact with websites today, from server-side crawlers to browser-based assistants, and why their limitations mirror long-standing accessibility issues. This isn’t about speculative futures. It’s about what is already happening, often invisibly, on live sites.

The session also looks at why this matters commercially. Agent-led browsing and purchasing changes how customers discover, compare, and buy. Sites that work well for agents are remembered and preferred. Sites that don’t are quietly avoided. The result is a first-mover advantage that is difficult to claw back later.

Finally, Tom will outline practical ways to respond. The focus is not on rebuilding interfaces or creating special agent-only experiences, but on making implicit state explicit. Small, well-understood changes that improve accessibility, resilience, and clarity for humans and machines alike.

As usual, this session is designed as a conversation rather than a presentation. There will be plenty of space for questions, shared experiences, and discussion of real-world challenges from the group.
