# Partner Sales Enablement Kit

This kit is designed for Agencies, Consultancies, and Partners selling "Agent Compatibility" services. Use these templates to open conversations, handle objections, and close implementation deals.

## 1. Outreach Templates

### Template A: The "Blind Spot" (For existing clients)

**Subject:** Important: Bot traffic on [Client Domain] - silent conversion failures

Hi [Name],

I was reviewing the analytics for [Client Domain] this week and noticed something we should discuss.

We're seeing a trend across the industry where AI agents (like ChatGPT, Claude, and shopping assistants) are attempting to visit sites to research products or complete tasks, but are failing silently because they can't "see" the visual cues we've designed for humans.

I ran a preliminary scan on your site using our new **Web Audit Suite**, and it flagged potential "Silent Conversion Failures" in your checkout flow. Specifically, the [specific element, e.g., 'Add to Cart' button] state relies on color changes that agents can't perceive.

I'd like to run a full audit (complementary) to see if you're losing revenue here. Are you free on Tuesday at 2pm?

Best,

[Your Name]

### Template B: The "Future Proofing" (For new prospects)

**Subject:** Will [Company Name] work for AI agents in 2026?

Hi [Name],

By 2026, it's estimated that 15-20% of web traffic will be AI agents acting on behalf of users—researching products, comparing prices, and booking services.

Most websites are built for human eyes only. When AI agents visit them, they break.

We help forward-thinking companies like [Company Name] ensure their digital infrastructure is "Agent Ready." This isn't just about future-proofing; it's about fixing accessibility debt that is likely hurting your human users right now.

I've attached a one-page executive summary on "The Invisible Users" problem. I'd love to share how we can turn this into a competitive advantage for you.

Best,

[Your Name]

## 2. Objection Handling Script

**Objection:** "AI is free/cheap, why should I pay for this?"
**Response:** "The AI agents themselves are free for users, but if your site blocks them or confuses them, you pay the cost in lost revenue. If an agent recommends your competitor because their site was easier to parse, you've lost that customer forever. We aren't selling you AI; we're selling you the *compatibility* to ensure you capture that traffic."

**Objection:** "We don't see any bot traffic in our analytics."
**Response:** "That's exactly the problem. Most AI agents fail silently or bounce instantly if they can't parse the page. They often don't trigger standard analytics events because they don't execute JavaScript the same way humans do. Our audit tool looks at the *code* structure to predict where these failures happen before they cost you sales."

**Objection:** "We are already WCAG compliant."
**Response:** "That's a fantastic start! WCAG compliance gets you 60% of the way there. However, AI agents have specific needs around 'State' and 'Context' that go beyond standard accessibility. For example, an agent needs to know not just *that* a button exists (accessibility), but *what happens* after it clicks it (determinism). Our audit covers that gap."

**Objection:** "Can't we just wait until this becomes standard?"
**Response:** "You can, but there is a 'First Mover Advantage.' Agents are learning right now which sites are reliable. If an agent learns that [Competitor] is easy to buy from and [Company] is hard, it will default to [Competitor] for future queries. You want to train the agents to prefer you *now*."

## 3. Proposal Structure

When pitching a "Web Audit & Remediation" engagement, structure your proposal as follows to maximize value perception:

### Phase 1: The Diagnostic (Fixed Fee: £5k - £15k)

* **Deliverable:** Technical Audit Report using the Web Audit Suite.
* **Value:** Identification of "Silent Conversion Failures" and a prioritized roadmap.

### Phase 2: The Remediation (Retainer or Project Fee)

* **Deliverable:** Implementation of semantic HTML, structured data, and state attributes.
* **Value:** "Agent-Ready"
* **Metric:** Improvement in 'LLM Suitability Score' from X to Y.

### Phase 3: The Maintenance (Monthly Retainer)

* **Deliverable:** Monthly scans and new pattern implementation.
* **Value:** Protection against regression as site content changes.
