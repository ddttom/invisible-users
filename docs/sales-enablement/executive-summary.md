# The Invisible Users: Executive Summary

An opportunity in AI agent-compatible web design

## The Opportunity in One Sentence

AI agents are visiting websites and failing silently, costing businesses millions in lost conversions - we've built the complete solution and need partners to scale delivery.

---

## The Problem

Modern websites work beautifully for humans but fail completely for AI agents. These failures are invisible:

- **No analytics data** - Lost conversions never appear in metrics
- **Silent failures** - Agents move on without error messages
- **£6.3 trillion market** - Global e-commerce affected
- **5-15% projected traffic** - AI agents by 2026
- **Multiple proprietary platforms** - Amazon Alexa+, Microsoft Copilot (verified); Google/Apple expected to follow

**Real Example:** An AI assistant compared tour operators. Company A's pagination made the agent think a 14-day tour was only 1 day. Company B showed full content on one page and won the business.

The patterns that break agents also break screen reader users, people with cognitive disabilities, and anyone processing pages sequentially. We've known about these problems for years - now there's commercial pressure to fix them. (For detailed analysis of the accessibility-agent connection, see Chapter 1 of the manuscript.)

**The proprietary lock-in reality:** Major platforms (Microsoft, Amazon verified; Google, Apple expected) are building closed identity systems to establish first-mover advantages before open standards emerge. Businesses must now test against multiple proprietary agent platforms, knowing each integration creates lock-in for customers and dependency for themselves. The industry must work to build open standards for identity delegation and agent interoperability.

## Market Timing: 12-18 Month Window

**Critical first-mover advantage period:**

- **Now (2026):** Early adopters capturing agent traffic
- **end 2026:** Agent traffic reaches 5-15% (inflection point)
- **2027:** Best practices become table stakes, advantage disappears

**Historical parallel:** Mobile-responsive design (2010-2013) had similar 3-year advantage window. We're at the 2010 equivalent.

---

## What We've Built

**Complete foundation for immediate market entry:**

1. **65,500-word book manuscript** (11 chapters + 9 appendices) - Establishes thought leadership
2. **Production-ready code examples** - HTML, React, WordPress, Next.js implementations
3. **Web Audit Suite** - Comprehensive Node.js analysis tool implementing all patterns
4. **Implementation methodology** - 4-priority-level systematic rollout
5. **Professional services framework** - Audit, implementation, retained support models
6. **Marketing website** - Lead generation, payment processing, content ready

**Status:** Publication-ready, all IP owned, no debt or obligations
