# LinkedIn About Profile

I help organisations make better strategic decisions about Adobe Experience Manager and Edge Delivery Services as AI agents reshape how web experiences get consumed. After architecting delivery infrastructure for BBC, Twitter, Nissan-Renault (200+ websites), Ford, and MediaMonks, I've learned that successful implementations come from asking the right questions first.

What most organisations miss: what breaks for AI agents also breaks for humans with disabilities, cognitive load, or non-ideal conditions. Hidden state, ephemeral notifications, incomplete information—these patterns fail universally. Amazon, Microsoft, and Google all launched agent commerce in January 2026. First movers who build genuinely agent-ready systems will capture agent-mediated transactions whilst competitors struggle with silent failures.

My work centres on "clarity infrastructure"—systems that make state explicit, feedback persistent, and information complete. I've implemented this at scale through semantic HTML, explicit state attributes, Schema.org data, and ensuring critical information exists before JavaScript execution. This creates foundations that work for CLI agents, browser agents, and every human user.
