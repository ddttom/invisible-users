### 1. Launch Announcement (Warm List)

**Subject:** The Invisible Users is here (+ 20% launch discount)

**Preheader:** AI agents are failing on websites - here's how to fix it

**Body:**

```text
Hi [First Name],

After months of work, I'm excited to announce that "The Invisible Users: Designing the Web for AI Agents and Everyone Else" is now available.

THE PROBLEM

AI agents are visiting websites right now and failing silently. These failures cost businesses millions in lost conversions that never appear in analytics.

I asked an AI assistant to compare tour operators. It recommended Company A over Company B because Company A used pagination - the agent saw only Day 1 of a 14-day tour and thought that was the entire offering.

The patterns that break agents also break screen reader users, people with cognitive disabilities, and anyone processing pages sequentially. We've known about these problems for years. Now there's commercial pressure to fix them.

WHAT'S IN THE BOOK

• 65,500 words across 11 chapters + 9 appendices
• Agent validation guardrails (Chapter 11)
• Production-ready code examples (HTML, React, WordPress, Next.js)
• Web Audit Suite (comprehensive analysis tool)
• Implementation checklist (4 priority levels)
• 60+ term glossary
• 150+ curated resources

LAUNCH PRICING (48 HOURS ONLY)

Digital Edition: £20 (normally £25) - 20% off
Complete Package: £60 (normally £75) - 20% off
Team License: £400 (normally £500) - 20% off

WHAT EARLY READERS SAY

"This book connected the dots between accessibility work we've been doing for years and the emerging agent compatibility challenges. The technical examples are immediately useful." - Sarah Chen, Senior Frontend Architect

"Finally, a book that addresses both the technical implementation AND the business implications." - Marcus Thompson, VP Product

### 3. Partner Outreach (Agency/Consultancy)

**Subject:** Partnership opportunity - AI agent-compatible web design

**Preheader:** £6.3T market, 12-18 month first-mover window

**Body:**

```text
Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out about a partnership opportunity in AI agent-compatible web design.

THE OPPORTUNITY

AI agents are visiting websites and failing silently - costing businesses millions in lost conversions. The patterns that break agents also break screen reader users. It's accessibility 2.0, with commercial pressure this time.

Market size: £6.3 trillion global e-commerce affected
Timing: 12-18 month first-mover advantage window
Competition: No established leaders yet

WHAT I'VE BUILT

• 50,000-word book (establishes thought leadership)
• Production-ready code examples and testing framework
• Complete implementation methodology
• Professional services framework
• Marketing website with lead generation

WHAT I NEED

Implementation capacity to scale delivery. One person can't handle the incoming demand.

PARTNERSHIP MODELS

1. White-Label Delivery (30-50% revenue share)
   - You deliver services under your brand
   - We provide methodology, training, support

2. Referral Network (15-20% commission)
   - You refer complex projects
   - We handle delivery, you receive referral fee

3. Joint Venture (negotiable terms)
   - Co-branded offerings
   - Shared delivery and sales

YEAR 1 REVENUE POTENTIAL

Services: £1.5M-£4M (audits, implementation, retained support)
Book sales: £375k-£750k
Speaking/advisory: £100k-£300k

Total: £2M-£5M Year 1 conservative

NEXT STEPS

If this interests you, I'd suggest:

1. 30-minute exploratory call
2. Review complete methodology and materials
3. Small pilot project to validate approach
4. Partnership agreement and launch

I've attached a brief executive summary with more details.

Are you open to an initial discussion?

Best,
Tom Cranstoun

P.S. The competitive window is limited. Early partners will establish market leadership before competitors enter.

### 6. Weekly Newsletter (Value-First)

**Subject:** Agent compatibility tip: Persistent error messages

**Preheader:** Why toast notifications break agents (and how to fix them)

**Body:**

```text
Hi [First Name],

This week's agent compatibility tip: persistent error messages.

THE PROBLEM

Toast notifications that vanish break both AI agents and screen reader users. The error appears, disappears, and the agent reports "success" when the form actually failed.

REAL EXAMPLE

User submits contact form with invalid email.
Toast appears: "Invalid email format"
Toast disappears after 3 seconds.
Agent reads page after toast gone: No error visible.
Agent tells user: "Form submitted successfully."

THE FIX

Keep errors visible in the DOM until user corrects them:

```html
<form data-form-state="incomplete">
  <div class="field" data-field-state="invalid">
    <label for="email">Email</label>
    <input
      type="email"
      id="email"
      aria-invalid="true"
      data-validation-state="invalid">
    <div class="error" role="alert">
      Please enter a valid email address
    </div>
  </div>
  <button disabled aria-disabled="true">
    Submit
  </button>
</form>
```text

KEY POINTS

1. Errors stay in DOM until fixed
2. Explicit state in attributes (not just CSS)
3. Button disabled until form valid
4. ARIA for screen readers

BENEFITS

✓ Agents read errors correctly
✓ Screen readers announce errors
✓ Users can reference error messages
✓ Form state is explicit and testable

TRY IT

Test your forms:

1. Submit invalid data
2. Wait 5 seconds
3. Check if error still visible
4. If not, you're breaking agents

RESOURCES

• Code example: [Link to GitHub]
• Full chapter on forms: [Link to book]
• Testing guide: [Link to blog]

SEE IT IN ACTION

Our website uses these patterns:
[Link to preview.html form]

Try submitting with invalid email - notice the error persists?

NEED HELP?

Reply to this email with your toughest agent compatibility question. I'll answer in next week's newsletter.

Best,
Tom Cranstoun

P.S. Forward this to a colleague who's building forms. They'll thank you.

### 10. Re-Engagement (Abandoned Cart)

**Subject:** Still thinking about The Invisible Users?

**Preheader:** Here's what others are saying...

**Body:**

```text

Hi [First Name],

I noticed you started to purchase "The Invisible Users" but didn't complete checkout. No worries - I wanted to reach out in case you had questions.

COMMON QUESTIONS

**"Is this too technical for non-developers?"**
Chapters 1-9 are accessible to anyone working with websites. Chapter 10 has code, but it's clearly marked and optional. Many product managers and designers find it valuable.

**"Will this become outdated quickly?"**
The core principles (semantic HTML, clear state, persistent feedback) are timeless. You'll receive lifetime updates as agent behaviors evolve.

**"Can I implement this on my existing site?"**
Yes. The book emphasizes incremental improvements over rebuilding. Many fixes take minutes or hours, not weeks.

**"What if I need hands-on help?"**
We offer professional services:
• Site audits: £5,000-£15,000
• Implementation: £25,000-£75,000
• Retained support: £5,000-£15,000/mo

WHAT READERS ARE SAYING

"This book connected the dots between accessibility work we've been doing for years and the emerging agent compatibility challenges." - Sarah Chen, Senior Frontend Architect

"The code examples are production-ready, not toy demos. We've already implemented several patterns across our e-commerce platform." - James Robertson, Lead Developer

Reply to this email. I read and respond to everything personally.
