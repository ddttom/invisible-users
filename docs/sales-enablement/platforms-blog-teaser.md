In seven days this January, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google launched AI agent commerce systems. Each bet billions on agents mediating online shopping - but they chose opposite strategies. Two went open (any merchant, any agent). One went closed (Microsoft only).

When Target and Walmart - fierce competitors - endorse the same open protocol, it signals where the industry is heading. Microsoft faces a strategic challenge competing against two open standards simultaneously.

The timeline just compressed. When an agent fails to navigate your site, it silently excludes you from recommendations. You lose thousands of potential customers who never knew you existed.

I've been documenting this shift for two years in "The Invisible Users: Designing the Web for AI Agents and Everyone Else" (Q1 2026). The book provides technical patterns that work regardless of which protocol wins - semantic HTML, structured data, explicit state management, persistent feedback.

I'm presenting at the Boye & Company members call on Wednesday, January 21st. Free registration, recording provided. We'll cover invisible barriers, practical fixes, and what the 6-9 month timeline means for your business.

Three platforms launched. The agents are here. Are you ready?
