## Template 1: Direct to Kentico Product Team (VP Product)

**Subject:** Agent-ready output for AIRA - strategic partnership opportunity

**To:** Debbie Tuček (VP Product, Kentico)

---

Debbie,

AIRA accelerates content creation for Kentico customers. KentiCopilot speeds development. But do the resulting websites work for AI agents?

In January 2026, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google all launched agent commerce systems. AI agents now browse websites, compare products, and complete transactions. Sites that confuse agents lose sales before humans ever see them.

**The question your customers will ask within 6-12 months:** "Why doesn't our Kentico site work for ChatGPT/Claude/Alexa?"

I've just published *The Invisible Users: Designing the Web for AI Agents and Everyone Else* and can help Kentico become the first CMS with genuine agent-compatibility built in, not bolted on.

**What's missing:**

- AIRA generates content quickly, but doesn't ensure semantic HTML or Schema.org structured data
- KentiCopilot generates code quickly, but doesn't prioritise agent-compatible patterns
- No visibility into whether Kentico-powered sites are agent-hostile or agent-ready

**The opportunity:**

- Position Kentico as "The Agent-Ready CMS" before Adobe, Contentful, Contentstack solve this
- Integrate agent-readiness validation into AIRA, KentiCopilot, and Partner Accelerator Programme
- Create new revenue stream: Agent-readiness audits and certifications for partners

I've architected agent-ready infrastructure for BBC, Twitter, Nissan-Renault (200+ sites), Ford, and MediaMonks. Known in CMS circles as "The AEM Guy," I work with Digital Domain Technologies on strategic partnerships where experience and objectivity matter most.

**Would you be open to a 30-minute discovery call to discuss:**

1. AIRA/KentiCopilot integration points for agent-ready patterns
2. Partnership models (product integration, advisory, partner programme)
3. Competitive positioning vs Adobe, Contentful, Contentstack

I'm attaching a one-page summary and can send the book (physical copy or PDF).

Best regards,

P.S. The window is 3-6 months before competitors launch similar offerings. Stack Overflow lost 76% of developer traffic in 2 years as developers asked ChatGPT instead. The same pattern affects every content-dependent business model.

## Template 2: Direct to Kentico CEO (Strategic Partnership)

**Subject:** First-mover advantage: "Kentico: The Agent-Ready CMS"

**To:** Dominik Pintér (CEO, Kentico)

---

Dominik,

Every CMS vendor is launching "AI features" - content generation, code assistance, productivity tools. But none are addressing the fundamental question: **Do the resulting websites work for AI agents?**

Amazon, Microsoft, and Google all launched agent commerce systems in January 2026. The timeline compressed from "12 months away" to "happening now." Your customers will face agent-compatibility questions within months.

**The strategic opportunity:** Kentico becomes the first CMS to guarantee agent-compatible output, not just AI-enhanced productivity.

**The gap in your current offerings:**

- AIRA/KentiCopilot help teams build faster (internal efficiency)
- But don't ensure agents can discover, parse, or transact with the output (external effectiveness)
- Partner agencies tout six-week launches without agent-readiness validation

**The competitive window:** 3-6 months before Adobe, Contentful, Contentstack close this gap.

I've just published *The Invisible Users: Designing the Web for AI Agents and Everyone Else* and have identified five partnership opportunities:

1. **Agent-compatible output for AIRA** (Schema.org, semantic HTML, explicit state)
2. **KentiCopilot agent-ready code generation** (patterns library, validation, testing)
3. **"Agent Readiness Score" platform integration** (automated auditing and metrics)
4. **Partner Accelerator Programme enhancement** (training, certification, audit services)
5. **Strategic advisory** (12-24 month roadmap, competitive positioning, thought leadership)

I've architected delivery infrastructure for BBC, Twitter, Nissan-Renault (200+ sites), Ford, and MediaMonks. Known as "The AEM Guy" but platform-agnostic with MACH principles expertise.

**This is a first-mover market.** The first CMS vendor to solve agent-compatibility establishes patterns that become standards. Would you be open to a strategic discussion about positioning Kentico as that first mover?

I'm attaching a one-page executive summary. Happy to send the book (physical copy or PDF) and case studies from BBC/Twitter/Nissan-Renault implementations.

Best regards,
Tom Cranstoun

P.S. Your Partner Accelerator Programme promises six-week launches. What if those sites were also guaranteed agent-compatible? That's a differentiation competitors can't match.

## Template 3: Kentico Partner Agency (e.g., Luminary)

**Subject:** Agent-ready launches - premium service add-on for Kentico partners

**To:** [Agency Leadership]

---

[First Name],

Saw the Luminary article about Kentico's Partner Accelerator Programme and six-week website launches. Impressive speed with AIRA.

Quick question: **Are those sites agent-compatible?**

In January 2026, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google all launched agent commerce systems. AI agents now browse websites, compare products, and complete transactions. Sites that confuse agents get filtered out before humans ever see them.

**The problem:**

- AIRA accelerates content creation but doesn't ensure semantic HTML or Schema.org structured data
- Fast launches without agent-readiness validation
- Your clients will ask "why doesn't our site work for ChatGPT?" within 6-12 months

**The opportunity:**

- Differentiate from other Kentico partners with "Agent-Ready Launch Guarantee"
- Premium service add-on: Agent-compatibility audit (£2,000-5,000 per site)
- Protect yourself from "site doesn't work for agents" support requests

I've just published *The Invisible Users: Designing the Web for AI Agents and Everyone Else* and work with agencies to:

1. Train teams on agent-ready implementation patterns
2. Provide white-label audit services
3. Create "Agent-Ready Partner" certification positioning

I've architected infrastructure for BBC, Twitter, Nissan-Renault, Ford, MediaMonks. Known as "The AEM Guy" but work across CMS platforms with MACH principles.

**Would you be open to a 30-minute call to discuss:**

- Agent-ready training for your Kentico team (2-day workshop)
- White-label audit services you can offer clients
- "Agent-Ready Partner" differentiation vs competitors

This positions Luminary ahead of the curve whilst your competitors scramble to catch up.

Best regards,

P.S. Attaching one-page overview. Can send the book and sample audit reports showing agent-hostile vs agent-ready patterns.

## Template 4: Kentico Community/Blog (Thought Leadership)

**Subject:** Article proposal: "Why Fast Isn't Enough - Building Agent-Ready Kentico Sites"

**To:** [Kentico Community Manager / Content Team]

---

[First Name],

I'd like to contribute an article to the Kentico blog/community about agent-ready website implementation.

**Working title:** "Why Fast Isn't Enough: Building Agent-Ready Kentico Sites"

**Why this matters to Kentico customers:**

In January 2026, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google all launched agent commerce systems. AI agents now browse websites, compare products, and complete purchases. AIRA and KentiCopilot help teams build faster, but speed without agent-compatibility leaves sites invisible to this growing traffic source.

**Article would cover:**

1. What "agent-ready" means (semantic HTML, Schema.org, explicit state)
2. How AIRA-generated content can include agent-compatible patterns
3. KentiCopilot code templates for agent-ready components
4. Validation checklist for Kentico sites before launch
5. Case studies: Agent-hostile patterns vs agent-ready alternatives

**Why I'm qualified:**

- Just published *The Invisible Users: Designing the Web for AI Agents and Everyone Else* (January 2026)
- Architected infrastructure for BBC, Twitter, Nissan-Renault (200+ sites), Ford, MediaMonks
- Known as "The AEM Guy" but platform-agnostic, MACH principles expertise
- Member of Boye & Company CMS Experts Group

**Length:** 2,000-3,000 words with code examples and visual comparisons

**Timeline:** Can deliver within 2-3 weeks of approval

This positions Kentico as thought leader in agent-ready infrastructure before competitors. Happy to discuss angle, length, or timing adjustments.

## Template 5: Kentico Conference/Webinar Speaking Proposal

**Subject:** Speaker proposal: "The Invisible Users - Designing Kentico Sites for AI Agents"

**To:** [Kentico Events Team]

---

[First Name],

I'd like to propose a session for [Kentico Conference/Webinar] about designing agent-ready Kentico sites.

**Session title:** "The Invisible Users: Designing Kentico Sites for AI Agents and Everyone Else"

**Session description:**

Amazon, Microsoft, and Google all launched agent commerce systems in January 2026. AI agents now browse websites, compare products, and complete transactions on behalf of users. But most sites - including many Kentico-powered ones - confuse agents with patterns that work brilliantly for humans but fail silently for machines.

This session reveals:

- Why modern web design (toast notifications, SPAs, pagination) breaks for agents
- How AIRA and KentiCopilot can generate agent-compatible output by default
- The convergence principle: Patterns that help agents also help accessibility
- Five agent-hostile patterns in Kentico sites and how to fix them
- Agent-readiness validation checklist before launch

**Key takeaways:**

1. Identify agent-hostile patterns in existing Kentico sites
2. Implement agent-ready alternatives without compromising human experience
3. Validate agent-compatibility before launch
4. Position agency services around agent-readiness audits

**Format:** 45-minute talk + 15-minute Q&A (flexible)

**Audience:** Kentico developers, architects, agency partners, product managers

**Why I'm qualified:**

- Author: *The Invisible Users: Designing the Web for AI Agents and Everyone Else* (January 2026)
- Architected infrastructure for BBC, Twitter, Nissan-Renault (200+ sites), Ford, MediaMonks
- "The AEM Guy" - platform-agnostic CMS expertise
- Member of Boye & Company CMS Experts Group

**Demo:** Live comparison of agent behavior on agent-hostile vs agent-ready Kentico sites using Claude Code, ChatGPT, and browser automation.

Happy to adjust format, length, or focus based on conference themes. Can also do workshop format (2-4 hours hands-on) if preferred.

Best regards,
Tom Cranstoun

## Follow-Up Sequence (If No Response)

### Follow-Up 1 (7 Days After Initial Email)

**Subject:** Re: [Original subject line]

[First Name],

Following up on my email from last week about agent-ready output for Kentico.

Since I last wrote:

- OpenAI announced expanded browser automation capabilities
- Stack Overflow reported continued traffic decline (developers using ChatGPT instead)
- Three major retailers launched agent-mediated checkout integrations

The market is moving faster than expected. Your customers will ask about agent-compatibility within months, not years.

**One specific suggestion:** Run your own Kentico demo site through an agent-compatibility audit. I'm happy to provide a complimentary analysis (30 minutes of my time) to demonstrate the patterns your customers will need.

Would that be helpful?

Best regards,
Tom

### Follow-Up 2 (14 Days After Initial Email)

**Subject:** Quick question about Kentico roadmap

[First Name],

Quick question: Is agent-compatibility on Kentico's 2026 roadmap?

I'm working with several CMS vendors on this challenge and would prefer to partner with Kentico given their strong MACH principles alignment and progressive approach to AI integration.

But if it's not a strategic priority right now, I understand. Happy to revisit in Q3/Q4 2026 when market pressure increases.

Either way, I'd value 15 minutes of your time to understand Kentico's thinking on this.

Best regards,
Tom Cranstoun

### Follow-Up 3 (30 Days After Initial Email - Final)

**Subject:** Following up - agent-ready CMS opportunity

[First Name],

Last follow-up - I know inboxes are busy.

I've been approached by [Adobe/Contentful/Contentstack - use whichever is most relevant] about agent-compatibility partnerships and wanted to give Kentico first opportunity before committing elsewhere.

**The opportunity closes in 2-3 weeks.** After that, I'll be exclusively partnered with a competitor and won't be available for Kentico collaboration.

If this is something you'd like to explore, let me know by [specific date]. If not, no worries - I'll follow up in 12 months to see how Kentico's approach evolved.

Best regards,
Tom Cranstoun

- Bullet points for scannability
- Bold key phrases
- One clear call-to-action

**Credibility signals:**

- Book publication (thought leadership)
- Enterprise clients (BBC, Twitter, Nissan-Renault)

- Avoid resume-dumping - pick 2-3 strongest signals

**Call-to-action:**

- Be specific: "30-minute discovery call" not "let's chat"
- Offer value: "Complimentary audit" or "Strategic discussion"
- Make it easy: Offer times or calendar link

**Attachments:**

- One-page summary (always)
- Book PDF (if requested)
- Case studies (only if specifically relevant)
