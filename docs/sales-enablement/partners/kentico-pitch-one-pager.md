# Kentico + Agent-Ready Infrastructure Partnership

One-Page Executive Summary

---

## The Problem Kentico Customers Will Face

**AIRA accelerates content creation. KentiCopilot speeds development. But do the resulting websites work for AI agents?**

In January 2026, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google all launched agent commerce systems. AI agents now browse websites, compare products, and complete transactions on behalf of users. **Sites that confuse agents lose sales before humans ever see them.**

**The gap:** Kentico helps teams build faster, but doesn't ensure agent-accessible output. Within 6-12 months, your customers will ask: "Why doesn't our Kentico site work for ChatGPT/Claude/Alexa?"

## What's Missing from Current Offerings

| What Kentico Offers | What Agents Need | The Gap |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ------- |
| AIRA generates content quickly | Semantic HTML, Schema.org structured data, explicit state attributes | Content is fast but not agent-readable |
| KentiCopilot generates boilerplate code | Agent-compatible patterns by default | Code is fast but not agent-ready |
| Six-week launches via Partner Accelerator | Agent-readiness validation before launch | Speed without compliance |
| Marketing productivity gains | Discovery by AI agents (GEO optimization) | Internal efficiency, external invisibility |

---

## The Opportunity: "First Agent-Ready CMS"

**Positioning:** Kentico becomes the first CMS vendor to guarantee agent-compatible output, not just AI-enhanced productivity.

**Competitive advantage:** Adobe, Contentful, Contentstack haven't solved this. 3-6 month window to establish thought leadership.

**Market urgency:** Agent commerce launched January 2026. Timeline compressed from "12 months" to "now." First movers capture agent-mediated transactions.

---

## Why This Matters Now

**Stack Overflow case study:** Developer traffic declined 76% in 2 years as developers ask ChatGPT instead of visiting Stack Overflow. This pattern affects ALL content sites.

**Commerce urgency:** Amazon Alexa.com, Microsoft Copilot Checkout, Google Universal Commerce Protocol all launched January 2026. Agent-mediated purchasing is production reality.

**Kentico customer impact:** Sites that work reliably for agents get recommended. Sites that confuse agents get filtered out before humans see them.

## The Patterns That Matter

**What agents need from websites:**

1. **Semantic HTML** - `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>` structure parseable without JavaScript
2. **Explicit state** - data-validation-state, data-agent-visible attributes (not just visual cues)
3. **Structured data** - Schema.org JSON-LD for products, services, content
4. **Persistent feedback** - Error messages that stay visible (not ephemeral toast notifications)
5. **Complete information** - Single-page content (not forced pagination hiding details)

**The convergence principle:** Patterns that help keyboard users also help AI agents. Agent-friendly design reinforces accessibility best practices.
