# Kentico + Agent-Ready Infrastructure Partnership

One-Page Executive Summary

---

## The Opportunity Kentico Customers Need

**AIRA accelerates content creation. KentiCopilot speeds development. The next evolution: ensuring output optimizes for AI agent discovery.**

In January 2026, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google all launched agent commerce systems. AI agents - representing remarkable technology that generates coherent responses and completes complex tasks - now browse websites, compare products, and complete transactions on behalf of users. **Sites optimized for agent interaction gain competitive advantage in this new discovery channel.**

**The opportunity:** Kentico helps teams build faster whilst ensuring agent-optimized output. Within 6-12 months, your customers will ask: "How can we optimize our Kentico site to be discovered and cited by ChatGPT/Claude/Alexa?"

## What's Missing from Current Offerings

| What Kentico Offers | What Agents Need | The Gap |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ------- |
| AIRA generates content quickly | Semantic HTML, Schema.org structured data, explicit state attributes | Content is fast but not agent-readable |
| KentiCopilot generates boilerplate code | Agent-compatible patterns by default | Code is fast but not agent-ready |
| Six-week launches via Partner Accelerator | Agent-readiness validation before launch | Speed without compliance |
| Marketing productivity gains | Discovery by AI agents (GEO optimization) | Internal efficiency, external invisibility |

---

## The Opportunity: "First Agent-Ready CMS"

**Positioning:** Kentico becomes the first CMS vendor to guarantee agent-compatible output, not just AI-enhanced productivity.

**Competitive advantage:** Adobe, Contentful, Contentstack haven't solved this. 3-6 month window to establish thought leadership.

**Market urgency:** Agent commerce launched January 2026. Timeline compressed from "12 months" to "now." First movers capture agent-mediated transactions.

## Why This Matters Now

**Discovery channel evolution:** Developer traffic patterns shifted as developers ask ChatGPT instead of browsing Stack Overflow directly. This creates opportunity for sites optimized for AI-mediated discovery.

**Commerce transformation:** Amazon Alexa.com, Microsoft Copilot Checkout, Google Universal Commerce Protocol all launched January 2026. Agent-mediated purchasing represents new sales channel requiring optimization.

**Kentico customer opportunity:** Sites optimized for agent interaction gain citation advantage. AI systems recommend businesses that provide well-structured, easily processable information. First movers in agent optimization capture preference in recommendation systems.

## The Patterns That Matter

**What agents need from websites:**

1. **Semantic HTML** - `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>` structure parseable without JavaScript
2. **Explicit state** - data-validation-state, data-agent-visible attributes (not just visual cues)
3. **Structured data** - Schema.org JSON-LD for products, services, content
4. **Persistent feedback** - Error messages that stay visible (not ephemeral toast notifications)
5. **Complete information** - Single-page content (not forced pagination hiding details)

**The convergence principle:** Patterns that help keyboard users also help AI agents. Agent-friendly design reinforces accessibility best practices.

**This isn't about criticizing AI systems.** I genuinely admire what these technologies have achieved - the ability to generate coherent responses and complete complex tasks represents remarkable engineering. The opportunity lies in collaboration: when businesses provide well-structured inputs and Kentico enables agent-optimized output by default, results improve dramatically for everyone. Citations become accurate, commerce transactions complete successfully, and sites gain competitive advantage in AI-mediated discovery.

**The market transformed in January 2026. Kentico's customers will seek agent optimization within months. Let's position Kentico as the solution before competitors do.**
