# Business Plan: The Invisible Users

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** December 2025
**Author:** Tom Cranstoun

## Executive Summary

"The Invisible Users: Designing the Web for AI Agents and Everyone Else" addresses a critical emerging problem: AI agents are visiting websites on behalf of users, and common web design patterns cause these agents to fail silently. This creates invisible conversion losses for businesses and accessibility barriers for humans.

**The opportunity exists because:**

1. **Timing is perfect:** The problem is visible, urgent, but solutions are not yet standardised
2. **Multiple revenue streams:** Book sales, consulting, training, software tools, licensing
3. **Dual value proposition:** Fixes both AI agent compatibility AND human accessibility
4. **First-mover advantage:** Limited competition in this specific intersection
5. **Market urgency:** Businesses losing money now from invisible agent failures

**Target market size:**

- Global e-commerce: $6.3 trillion (2024)
- SaaS market: $232 billion (2024)
- Digital publishing/content: $400+ billion (2024)
- Web development services: $40+ billion (2024)

**Competitive advantage:**

- Complete, publication-ready manuscript (~57,000 words: 11 chapters + 10 appendices published separately online)
- Web Audit Suite (production-ready analysis tool)
- Practical, working code examples
- Interactive notebook companion
- Established author platform (allabout.network)
- Real-world implementation experience
- Business + technical + ethical coverage (not just technical guides)

## Market Analysis

### Problem Definition

**The Core Problem:**

Websites built for human visual browsing fail for AI agents that parse sequentially. This causes:

- Lost e-commerce conversions (agents can't complete checkouts)
- Incorrect agent recommendations (agents miss paginated content)
- Failed form submissions (agents can't detect validation errors)
- Pricing confusion (agents can't see full pricing)

**Why It Matters Now:**

1. **Agent adoption accelerating:** ChatGPT, Claude, and other assistants increasingly used for web research
2. **Commercial pressure building:** Businesses losing sales but don't know why
3. **No standardised solutions:** Best practices still forming
4. **Accessibility convergence:** Same patterns hurt disabled users (creates regulatory pressure)

**Validation method:** Compare bounce rates for sessions under 10 seconds against industry baseline. Unusually high short-session bounces combined with declining conversion despite stable traffic often indicate agent extraction without attribution.

### Target Markets

## Competitive Analysis

### Direct Competitors

#### 1. Accessibility Consultancies

- **Examples:** WebAIM, Deque, Level Access
- **Strengths:** Established, credibility, compliance expertise
- **Weaknesses:** Don't specifically address AI agents, expensive
- **Differentiation:** We cover AI + accessibility convergence, more technical depth

#### 2. AI/ML Consultants

- **Examples:** Individual consultants, ML agencies
- **Strengths:** Deep AI expertise
- **Weaknesses:** Don't understand web design/UX, purely technical
- **Differentiation:** We understand both web design AND AI agent needs

#### 3. Web Development Educators

- **Examples:** Frontend Masters, Udemy instructors
- **Strengths:** Large audiences, established platforms
- **Weaknesses:** General content, not specialised
- **Differentiation:** Niche expertise, timely topic, business + technical

### Indirect Competitors

#### 4. Technical Publishers' Books

- **Examples:** O'Reilly, Pragmatic Bookshelf books on web development
- **Strengths:** Distribution, credibility
- **Weaknesses:** Slow (18-24 month publication cycle), general topics
- **Differentiation:** First mover on this specific topic, faster to market

#### 5. Testing Tool Companies

- **Examples:** Playwright, Cypress, Selenium documentation
- **Strengths:** Free, technical depth
- **Weaknesses:** Tool-specific, no business context
- **Differentiation:** Tool-agnostic, business implications included

#### 6. AI Platform Documentation

- **Examples:** OpenAI, Anthropic guides
- **Strengths:** Authoritative, free
- **Weaknesses:** Platform-specific, developer audience only
- **Differentiation:** Cross-platform, multi-audience (dev + business)

### Competitive Advantages

#### 1. Timing (First Mover)

- Topic is emerging NOW
- No comprehensive books exist yet
- 12-18 month window before competition catches up

#### 2. Unique Positioning

- AI + Accessibility + Business + Technical = no one else covers all four
- Real-world implementation experience
- Practical code, not just theory

**Citation capture creates durable competitive moats:** First businesses in each sector to capture agent citations become default recommendations. When users ask AI assistants for products/services, agents cite businesses with successful transaction history. Citation capture creates durable competitive moats - second place often becomes invisible.

#### 3. Complete Package

- Book + code + interactive notebook + training + consulting
- Competitors have 1-2 of these, not all

#### 4. Author Platform

- Established blog (allabout.network)
- LinkedIn presence
- Real consulting experience (credibility)

#### 5. Supporting Materials

- 60+ glossary terms
- Implementation checklist
- Resource links (150+ curated)
- Agent-Friendly Starter Kit (working code)

### Competitive Threats

**Threat 1: Fast followers**

- **Risk:** Other authors/consultants see the opportunity
- **Mitigation:** Move fast, establish thought leadership, build moat through community

**Threat 2: AI platforms solve it themselves**

- **Risk:** OpenAI/Anthropic release comprehensive guides
- **Mitigation:** Our guide is cross-platform and includes business context they won't provide

**Threat 3: Standards bodies move faster than expected**

- **Risk:** W3C or similar standardises solutions, making book less relevant
- **Mitigation:** Position as implementation guide for standards, not inventing standards

**Threat 4: Market doesn't materialise**

- **Risk:** AI agent usage doesn't grow as expected
- **Mitigation:** Accessibility angle remains valuable, book has dual value proposition

**Threat 5: Tools automate the fixes**

- **Risk:** Automated tools make manual implementation unnecessary
- **Mitigation:** Shift to consulting on strategy, tool selection, and complex cases

### Barriers to Entry (For Competitors)

**What protects this business:**

1. **Knowledge/Experience:** Deep understanding of web + AI + accessibility is rare
2. **Time Investment:** 6-12 months to research and write comprehensive content
3. **Credibility:** Real implementation experience, not just theory
4. **Network Effects:** Early community building creates defensible position
5. **Brand Recognition:** First mover advantage in specialist niche

**How long is the moat?**

- Strong moat: 12-18 months (until mid-2026)
- Weakening moat: 18-36 months (2027)
- Commoditised: 36+ months (2028+)

**Strategy: Extract maximum value during strong moat period, then transition to tools/SaaS with higher barriers to entry**

  - Position as "official implementation guide"
  - Expand into tool development quickly

**Risk 3: AI platforms solve the problem**

- **Probability:** Medium (25%)
- **Impact:** High (makes book less critical)

- **Mitigation:**
  - Launch consulting immediately (generates cash)
  - Phased investment (don't spend on Phase 3 until Phase 2 profitable)
  - Personal runway or line of credit
  - Pre-sales for courses/tools

**Risk 12: Pricing too high/low**

- **Probability:** Medium (30%)
- **Impact:** Medium (reduces revenue or margins)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Market research (survey potential customers)
  - Test pricing with early access
  - Offer multiple tiers
  - Adjust based on feedback

### Risk Mitigation Summary

**Overall risk profile: Medium**

- Strong product/market fit potential
- Significant execution risk (solo founder, ambitious scope)
- Market timing risk both ways (too early or too late)
- Multiple mitigation strategies in place

**Recommended approach:**

1. Launch fast with book + consulting (low risk, immediate revenue)
2. Validate demand before heavy software investment
3. Scale through training/courses (medium risk, higher leverage)
4. Build tools only after proven demand (high risk, highest scalability)

**Option 3: Angel Investment**

- Raise £100,000-250,000 for 10-20% equity
- Target: Experienced operator or strategic investor
- **Advantages:** Mentorship, connections, faster scaling
- **Risks:** Dilution, pressure for growth over sustainability

**Option 4: Revenue-Based Financing**

- Borrow £50,000-150,000
- Repay as % of revenue until 1.5-2x returned
- **Advantages:** No dilution, aligned incentives
- **Risks:** Revenue pressure, caps available for other investments

**Recommendation:**

- **Phase 1:** Self-fund £10-15k (minimal risk)
- **Phase 2:** Bootstrap from revenue (£300k+ should be generated)
- **Phase 3:** Evaluate based on Phase 2 traction:
  - If strong: Bootstrap (sustainable lifestyle business)
  - If very strong: Consider angel/RBF for acceleration (scale to exit)
