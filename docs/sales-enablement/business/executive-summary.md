# The Invisible Users: Executive Summary

An opportunity in AI agent-compatible web design

## The Opportunity in One Sentence

AI agents are visiting websites and failing silently, costing businesses millions in lost conversions - we've built the complete solution and need partners to scale delivery.

---

## The Problem

Modern websites work beautifully for humans but fail completely for AI agents. These failures are invisible:

- **No analytics data** - Lost conversions never appear in metrics
- **Silent failures** - Agents move on without error messages
- **£6.3 trillion market** - Global e-commerce affected
- **5-15% projected traffic** - AI agents by 2026
- **Multiple proprietary platforms** - Amazon Alexa+, Microsoft Copilot, Google Business Agent (all launched January 2026); Apple expected to follow

**Quick diagnostic:** Compare bounce rates for sessions under 10 seconds against your industry baseline. Unusually high short-session bounces combined with declining conversion despite stable traffic often indicate agent extraction without attribution.

**Real Example:** An AI assistant compared tour operators. Company A's pagination made the agent think a 14-day tour was only 1 day. Company B showed full content on one page and won the business.

**The business model crisis is real.** In January 2025, Tailwind CSS laid off 75% of its team after their traffic-dependent revenue model collapsed. When AI agents started answering developer questions without sending traffic to documentation sites, the business couldn't sustain salaries. Founder Adam Wathan explained when rejecting an llms.txt integration: "Making it easier for LLMs to read our docs just means less traffic which means less people learning about our paid products and the business being even less sustainable." Companies depending on pageview-driven advertising, affiliate click-throughs, or awareness marketing requiring site visits face the same crisis. Adaptation is urgent: transform to agent-compatible revenue models (direct transactions, paid services, subscriptions) or watch revenue collapse whilst agents extract free content and paid offerings remain invisible.

The patterns that break agents also break users with disabilities: users navigating by keyboard alone, those relying on assistive technologies like screen readers, people using voice control due to mobility limitations, and individuals with cognitive disabilities who struggle with disappearing notifications. The convergence principle: skip links that help keyboard users bypass navigation also help AI agents identify main content. Semantic HTML benefits screen readers and AI parsing simultaneously. We've known about these problems for years - now there's commercial pressure to fix them. (For detailed analysis of the accessibility-agent connection, see Chapter 1 of the manuscript.)

**The proprietary lock-in reality:** Major platforms (Microsoft, Amazon, Google launched January 2026; Apple expected) are building closed identity systems to establish first-mover advantages before open standards emerge. Businesses must now test against multiple proprietary agent platforms, knowing each integration creates lock-in for customers and dependency for themselves. The industry must work to build open standards for identity delegation and agent interoperability.

## Market Timing: 12-18 Month Window

**Critical first-mover advantage period:**

- **Now (2026):** Early adopters capturing agent traffic
- **end 2026:** Agent traffic reaches 5-15% (inflection point)
- **2027:** Best practices become table stakes, advantage disappears

**Historical parallel:** Mobile-responsive design (2010-2013) had similar 3-year advantage window. We're at the 2010 equivalent.

---

## Target Audience

**"The Invisible Users"** is written primarily for business leaders and managers who need to understand the strategic implications of AI agent commerce - including CEOs, product managers, marketing directors, and technical managers such as software architects and lead developers.

**No programming knowledge required.** Technical patterns are explained conceptually first, then demonstrated with code examples that can be skipped without losing the thread of the argument. If you don't write code, you can read straight through and gain everything needed to make informed strategic decisions.

**For technical readers** (developers, architects, DevOps engineers): The book can be read backwards. Start with the implementation chapters (10-13) to see the concrete patterns, then work backwards through the business justification, conceptual framework, and strategic context. You already understand the "how" - you need to understand the "why" to advocate for these changes within your organisation.

The convergence principle means both audiences benefit: business leaders understand why agent compatibility creates competitive advantage, whilst technical teams understand which patterns deliver measurable business impact rather than speculative future-proofing.

- **Agency partnerships:** Revenue share on white-label delivery
- **Enterprise licensing:** £100k-£500k annual deals

**3-Year Conservative Projection:** £10M+ revenue
**3-Year Optimistic Projection:** £25M+ revenue

---

## Competitive Advantages

1. **First-mover authority** - First comprehensive book, established methodology before competitors
2. **Technical depth** - 30 years web experience, production-ready code, testing framework
3. **Business case articulation** - ROI frameworks help enterprises justify investment
4. **Universal approach** - Works for all agent types, benefits human users, standards-based
5. **Complete offering** - Education → Assessment → Implementation → Monitoring

**Market Position:** No established leaders, 12-18 month window to dominate

**The first-mover citation advantage:** When users ask AI assistants for recommendations, agents cite businesses they've successfully transacted with previously. The first business in each sector to implement agent-friendly patterns establishes preference in agent recommendation systems. Second place often becomes invisible - agents cite whoever they found first and worked reliably. Successful agent interactions compound, increasing the likelihood of future citations. Platforms like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic deprioritize sites where agents consistently fail. Sites that work reliably gain platform trust, leading to more frequent citations and higher visibility.
