# Business Opportunities - Agent-Ready Infrastructure Consulting

This document tracks business development opportunities identified through market analysis, news monitoring, and strategic positioning.

**Last updated:** 2026-01-17

## Overview

The agent-ready infrastructure market has clear gaps where established vendors (CMS platforms, development agencies, enterprise software) have launched "AI features" without addressing the fundamental question: **Do the resulting websites work for AI agents?**

Our strategic advantage: *The Invisible Users* book establishes thought leadership on agent-website compatibility patterns. Most vendors focus on internal AI productivity tools (content generation, code assistance) rather than agent-accessible output.

---

## Current Opportunity: Kentico (CMS Platform Vendor)

### Background

**Company:** Kentico Software (established CMS/DXP vendor)

**Recent launches:**

- **AIRA** (March 2025) - AI marketing assistant for content creation, translation, metadata generation
- **KentiCopilot** - Developer-focused AI tools with MCP servers for documentation, boilerplate code generation
- **Content Strategist agent** (roadmap) - Strategic content planning and gap analysis
- **Partner Accelerator Program** - Six-week website launches with agency partners (e.g., Luminary)

**Market positioning:** Competing on speed and AI-enhanced productivity for marketers and developers

### The Gap We Identified

**What Kentico offers:** AI tools that help teams BUILD websites faster

**What Kentico doesn't offer:** Assurance that resulting websites WORK for AI agents

**The disconnect:**

- AIRA generates content quickly, but doesn't ensure semantic HTML, structured data, or explicit state attributes
- KentiCopilot generates boilerplate code, but doesn't prioritise agent-compatible patterns
- Partner agencies tout six-week launches without addressing agent readiness
- No visibility into whether Kentico-powered sites are agent-hostile or agent-friendly

**Why this matters:**

- Kentico customers will face "why doesn't our site work for agents?" questions within 6-12 months
- Competitors (Adobe, Contentful, Contentstack) will launch similar offerings
- First CMS vendor to solve agent-compatibility captures thought leadership and market share

### Five Service Offerings for Kentico

#### 1. Agent-Compatible Output Layer for AIRA

**Problem:** AIRA accelerates content creation but doesn't ensure agent accessibility

**Solution:**

- Automatic Schema.org JSON-LD generation integrated with AIRA's content output

- Semantic HTML enforcement within Kentico's page builder
- Integration between AIRA's content intelligence and structured data requirements

**Deliverables:**

- MCP server extension for AIRA
- Pattern library for agent-ready content templates
- Validation rules flagging agent-hostile patterns
- Documentation and training materials

### Approach Strategy

#### Option A: Direct Outreach to Kentico Product Team

**Contact targets:**

- Debbie Tuček (VP of Product)
- Dominik Pintér (CEO)

**Initial pitch:**
> "AIRA accelerates content creation, but doesn't ensure that content works for AI agents accessing your customers' sites. I've just published *The Invisible Users* and can help Kentico become the first CMS with genuine agent-compatibility built in, not bolted on. Amazon, Microsoft, and Google all launched agent commerce in January 2026. Your customers will face 'why doesn't our site work for agents?' questions within months. Let's position Kentico as the solution before competitors do."

**Supporting materials:**

- Book (physical copy + PDF)
- Executive summary highlighting CMS vendor opportunities
- One-page capability statement
- Case study: BBC/Twitter/Nissan-Renault implementations

---

#### Option B: Partnership with Kentico Agency Partners

**Contact targets:**

- Luminary (APAC, "Accelerator Expert" launch partner)
- Other Partner Accelerator Programme agencies

**Initial pitch:**
> "Your six-week launches with AIRA are impressive. What if those sites were also guaranteed agent-compatible? I can train your team on agent-ready patterns and provide audit services you can offer clients as premium add-on. This differentiates you from other Kentico partners and protects you from 'site doesn't work for agents' support requests."

**Supporting materials:**

- Partner toolkit preview (audit templates, proposal templates)
- ROI case study showing agent-readiness premium pricing
- Training curriculum outline

---

#### Option C: Thought Leadership via Kentico Events/Community

**Opportunities:**

- Speak at Kentico conference/webinars
- Contribute to Kentico blog/documentation
- Partner with Kentico on joint webinar series

**Talk/article ideas:**

- "Why Fast Isn't Enough: Building Agent-Ready Kentico Sites"
- "The Invisible Users: What AIRA Can't Fix (Yet)"
- "From Six-Week Launches to Agent-Proof Infrastructure"
- "How Kentico Customers Can Prepare for Agent Commerce"

**Value:** Establishes credibility within Kentico ecosystem, generates inbound leads from partners and customers

---

### Why Timing is Perfect

1. **Kentico just launched AIRA** (March 2025) - they're in "what's next?" mode, open to partnerships
2. **Your book just published** (January 2026) - fresh credibility and thought leadership positioning
3. **Amazon/Microsoft/Google launched agent commerce** (January 2026) - market urgency is real, not theoretical
4. **Luminary article demonstrates the gap** - focus on speed without agent-readiness awareness
5. **No competitor has solved this yet** - 3-6 month window before Adobe/Contentful launch similar offerings

---

### Key Differentiators in Pitch

**What we're NOT offering:**

- Generic "AI consulting" (market is flooded)
- Theoretical frameworks without implementation
- Single-site fixes that don't scale

**What we ARE offering:**

- Platform-level solutions benefiting ALL Kentico customers
- Concrete patterns with working code (Web Audit Suite + book appendices)
- Competitive advantage: "First agent-ready CMS"
- New revenue category: Agent-readiness audits and certifications

**Why us:**

- "The AEM Guy" reputation (not vendor-locked, credible across CMS platforms)
- Architected for BBC, Twitter, Nissan-Renault, Ford, MediaMonks (enterprise-scale credibility)
- Published THE book on agent-website compatibility (thought leadership)
- MACH principles expertise (Kentico's architectural direction)
- Digital Domain Technologies structure (credible consultancy, not individual freelancer)

---

## Replicable Pattern: Other CMS/DXP Vendors

The Kentico opportunity reveals a replicable pattern across CMS and DXP vendors:

### Potential targets

- **Adobe Experience Manager** (already have relationships via "The AEM Guy" reputation)
- **Contentful** (headless CMS, API-first architecture)
- **Contentstack** (composable DXP)
- **Sitecore** (enterprise DXP)
- **Sanity** (developer-focused headless CMS)
- **WordPress VIP** (enterprise WordPress)

### Universal gap

All vendors focus on:

- AI-assisted content creation
- Developer productivity tools
- Internal workflow optimisation

None focus on:

- Agent-accessible output
- Structured data generation
- Explicit state management
- Agent-compatibility validation

### Universal pitch framework

> "Your [AI feature] helps teams build faster. But do the resulting sites work for AI agents? Amazon, Microsoft, and Google launched agent commerce in January 2026. Your customers will face 'why doesn't our site work for agents?' questions within months. I can help you become the first [CMS/DXP category] with genuine agent-compatibility built in."

## Risk Mitigation

### Competitive Risk

**Risk:** Adobe, Contentful, or Contentstack launch agent-readiness features before we close deals

**Mitigation:**

- Move fast on Kentico opportunity (3-6 month window)
- Emphasise thought leadership via book (competitors lack this)
- Position as "implementation partner" not just "advisor" (harder to replicate)

### Market Education Risk

**Risk:** Market doesn't understand agent-readiness urgency yet

**Mitigation:**

- Lead with Amazon/Microsoft/Google January 2026 launches (concrete, recent)
- Use Stack Overflow traffic decline case study (validated, measurable)
- Offer free workshops/webinars to educate market

### Vendor Lock-In Risk

**Risk:** Deep integration with one vendor (Kentico) limits other opportunities

**Mitigation:**

- Platform-agnostic patterns (book establishes this)
- Emphasise Web Audit Suite works with any CMS
- Maintain "The AEM Guy" positioning (multi-platform credibility)

---

## Conclusion

The Kentico analysis revealed a consistent pattern: **vendors build AI productivity tools but ignore agent-accessible output**. This gap exists across CMS/DXP market and represents immediate revenue opportunity.

**Strategic positioning:**

- *The Invisible Users* book = thought leadership
- Enterprise implementation experience (BBC, Twitter, etc.) = credibility
- Web Audit Suite = tangible tooling
- "The AEM Guy" reputation = multi-platform trust

**Market timing:** 3-6 month window before competitors close the gap. First movers capture thought leadership and establish patterns that become standards.

**Recommended focus:** Start with Kentico (clear gap, recent launches, partnership opportunities), then replicate for Adobe (existing relationships), then expand to Contentful/Contentstack/Sitecore.
