## Email Body

### Version 1: Professional/Academic Tone

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because of your expertise in [web development/accessibility/AI implementation/product management]. I've written a book about a problem that's affecting conversion rates right now, and I'd value your feedback before publication.

**The problem:** AI agents are visiting websites and failing silently. The same design patterns that work beautifully for human users - toast notifications, visual state changes, paginated content - break completely for AI agents. And critically, these are the exact patterns that have been creating accessibility barriers for years.

I've documented this in a 65,500-word manuscript called "The Invisible Users: Designing the Web for AI Agents and Everyone Else." It covers:

- **Technical failures** - What breaks and why (with code examples)
- **Business implications** - ROI frameworks and strategic considerations
- **Practical solutions** - 11 chapters plus 9 appendices with copy-paste implementations
- **Agent validation** - Guardrails agent creators must build (Chapter 11)

The book includes:

- Implementation Cookbook (10 ready-to-use recipes)
- Battle-Tested Lessons (15 real-world mistakes to avoid)
- Web Audit Suite Guide (complete measurement framework)
- Production-ready code examples across multiple frameworks

**Why I'm asking you:**

[Choose one or customize:]

- Your work on [specific project/article] demonstrates deep understanding of [web standards/accessibility/agent systems]
- Your perspective on [specific topic] would be invaluable for validating the technical approach
- Your experience building [relevant systems] means you've likely encountered these patterns

**What I'm looking for:**

- Technical accuracy validation
- Gaps in coverage or missing considerations
- Clarity and usefulness of code examples
- Whether the business case resonates with [your industry/role]

**Time commitment:** The book is structured so you can review individual chapters based on your expertise (full manuscript available if you prefer). Most reviewers focus on 2-3 chapters that align with their background.

**Format:** I can provide PDF, Markdown, or HTML - whatever works best for you.

Would you be interested? I'm happy to share a table of contents first so you can see if it aligns with your interests.

Thanks for considering this.

Best regards,
Tom Cranstoun

### Version 2: Developer-Focused Tone

Hi [Name],

Quick question: Have you noticed AI agents struggling with websites that work perfectly for humans?

I've spent the past [timeframe] documenting this problem and building solutions. The result is a 65,500-word technical book called "The Invisible Users" - and I'd value your feedback before publishing.

**The core issue:**

Modern web patterns break AI agents:

- Toast notifications vanish before agents can read them
- Visual state changes (button colour) aren't detectable
- Client-side rendering leaves agents seeing "Loading..."
- Paginated content hides information agents never discover

These same patterns have been accessibility barriers for years. Now there's commercial pressure to fix them.

**What I've built:**

- **11 chapters** covering failures, business impact, technical solutions, and agent validation
- **9 appendices** with copy-paste recipes, real-world lessons, and pipeline failure analysis
- **Production code** across vanilla JS, React, Next.js, WordPress
- **Web Audit Suite** for comprehensive measurement and validation
- **Test framework** (Playwright) for verification

**Why you specifically:**

[Customize based on recipient]

- I saw your [article/project/comment] about [relevant topic]
- Your [specific expertise] would help validate the technical approach
- You've built [relevant systems] and likely encountered these problems

**What I need:**

Technical review of [2-3 chapters relevant to their expertise]:

- Code examples - do they work, are they production-ready?
- Patterns - are there better approaches I've missed?
- Coverage - what's missing that developers will need?

**Format:** Whatever works - PDF, Markdown, GitHub access, HTML.

**Time:** Most reviewers spend 2-3 hours on focused chapters rather than reading cover-to-cover.

Interested? I can send the table of contents and relevant chapters for your area.

Cheers,
Tom

### Version 3: Business/Product Leader Focus

Hi [Name],

I'm writing to you about a conversion problem that's invisible in analytics: AI agents failing on websites that work perfectly for human users.

I've documented this in a book manuscript that bridges technical implementation and business strategy. Given your role in [company/position], I'd value your feedback on whether the business case resonates and the solutions are practical.

**The business problem:**

- AI agents are already browsing websites and making purchase decisions
- They fail silently on patterns that work for humans (toast notifications, visual feedback, paginated content)
- Businesses lose transactions with no visibility in analytics or error logs
- Early movers gain first-mover advantage as agents learn which sites work

**What I've written:**

65,500 words covering:

- **Technical patterns** that break (with evidence)
- **Business implications** including ROI frameworks
- **Strategic considerations** for different industries
- **Implementation guidance** with priority levels
- **Agent validation** guardrails (Chapter 11)
- **Measurement frameworks** for tracking progress

**Why I'm asking you:**

Your experience with [specific context - e.g., "scaling e-commerce platforms" or "product decisions at X"] means you understand both technical feasibility and business justification. I need validation that:

- The ROI calculations are realistic
- The strategic framing makes sense for different business models
- The prioritization approach works for real product roadmaps
- The case studies resonate with actual business challenges

**Time commitment:**

I'd suggest focusing on:

- Chapter 4: The Business Reality (ROI frameworks)
- Chapter 9: Designing for Both (solution patterns)
- Appendix A: Implementation Cookbook (practical recipes)

Total reading time: ~2 hours. Feedback can be as detailed or high-level as you prefer.

Would this be useful to you? Happy to share just these chapters to start.

Best,
Tom Cranstoun

### Version 4: Accessibility Specialist Focus

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because you'll recognize the patterns I'm writing about - they're the same accessibility barriers advocates have been highlighting for years.

The difference now: AI agents are failing on these patterns too, and suddenly there's commercial pressure to fix them.

I've written a 65,500-word book called "The Invisible Users" that documents this connection and provides technical solutions. I'd value your perspective before publication.

**The uncomfortable parallel:**

The patterns that break AI agents are identical to accessibility barriers:

- Toast notifications → vanish before screen readers announce them
- Visual-only state → invisible to non-sighted users and agents
- Pagination → hides content from sequential processing
- Client-side rendering → fails without JavaScript
- Transient errors → missed by agents and screen reader users

**My thesis:**

Accessibility advocates have been right all along, but there wasn't enough commercial pressure to drive widespread adoption. Now AI agents struggling with the same patterns creates business incentive that might finally force fixes - which would benefit everyone.

**What I need from you:**

Validation that:

- I'm representing accessibility issues accurately
- The technical solutions genuinely help human users (not just agents)
- The framing is respectful and acknowledges the work already done
- I'm not missing critical accessibility considerations
- The business case doesn't undermine existing accessibility advocacy

**Relevant chapters for your expertise:**

- Chapter 8: The Human Cost (accessibility implications)
- Chapter 9: Designing for Both (universal solutions)
- Chapter 10: Technical Advice (implementation patterns)
- Appendix B: Battle-Tested Lessons (real-world implementations)

**Format:** Whatever works best for you - PDF, accessible HTML, Markdown.

This is an opportunity to ensure the book strengthens (not weakens) the case for accessible design. Your voice matters here.

Would you be willing to review?

Regards,
Tom Cranstoun

## Follow-up Email (if no response after 7-10 days)

Subject: Following up: Book review request

Hi [Name],

I sent a note last week about reviewing my book manuscript on AI agent compatibility patterns. I know you're busy, so just wanted to check if this landed in your inbox or if it's not a good fit right now.

No pressure either way - if timing doesn't work or it's not your area of interest, completely understand.

If you are interested but the full review seems too time-intensive, I'd also value:

- Quick scan of the table of contents with "what's missing?" feedback
- Review of just one chapter in your area of expertise
- General reactions to the premise and approach

Let me know what (if anything) would work.

Thanks,
Tom
