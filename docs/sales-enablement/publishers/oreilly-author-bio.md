# Author Biography - Extended

**Tom Cranstoun**
Author of "The Invisible Users: Designing the Web for AI Agents and Everyone Else"

## Professional Summary

Tom Cranstoun has been building content systems for 49 years - since before "CMS" was a term. He co-authored Superbase, a database and content management system that predated the CMS category, and built the BBC's news distribution system that served journalists globally.

Over the last 12 years architecting Adobe AEM platforms—including the world's largest deployment at 200+ sites across 30+ languages—and 3 years with Edge Delivery Services, he noticed something unexpected: the structure that makes content work for AI agents is mostly what everyone needs.

Currently focused on the intersection of human-optimised web design and AI agent compatibility, Tom brings production experience from both sides of the ecosystem: building websites that serve millions of users and developing AI agents that interact with those websites. Nearly five decades of pattern recognition across every generation of technology—from Superbase through BBC systems to modern Adobe platforms—informs his approach to this latest infrastructure transition.

## Current Focus

### AI Agent Compatibility Research (2023-Present)

Two years investigating what happens when AI agents encounter modern websites. Not web scraping. Not automated testing. Actual customer-facing agents attempting legitimate purchases with valid payment methods and delivery addresses. The research documented consistent, predictable failure patterns that were completely invisible to traditional analytics.

This investigation produced:

- Classification of five invisible failure categories
- Documentation of the January 2025 platform convergence (Google, Microsoft, Amazon launching within 7 days)
- Production-ready implementation patterns across multiple platforms
- Web Audit Suite tool for detecting agent compatibility issues
- This book: comprehensive guide from business implications through technical implementation

**Key insight discovered:** The patterns that break AI agents also break humans. Semantic HTML, explicit state management, and structured data - solutions accessibility experts recommended for years - are now infrastructure requirements driven by commercial pressure.

## Professional Experience

### Enterprise Content Management (2015-Present)

#### CMS Specialist

Recognised in the enterprise CMS community as "The AEM Guy" for deep technical expertise and strategic advisory work across multiple platforms.

**Key projects:**

## Industry Perspective

### Historical Context

49 years of content system development provides perspective on infrastructure transitions:

#### 1977-1990: CMS before the term existed

- Co-authored Superbase database and content management system
- Built BBC news distribution system serving journalists globally
- Established patterns for content that serves different consumers

#### 1998-2003: First e-commerce wave

- Built shopping carts before standardised platforms
- Learned infrastructure patterns through production failures
- Experienced first dot-com boom and bust

#### 2004-2010: AJAX and rich interfaces

- Single-page application architectures
- Progressive enhancement debates
- Mobile-first responsive design

#### 2011-2020: Modern JavaScript frameworks

- React, Angular, Vue adoption
- API-first architectures
- Headless CMS patterns

#### 2021-Present: AI agent compatibility

- Platform convergence (January 2025)
- Agent-mediated commerce infrastructure
- Return to semantic HTML and progressive enhancement

This historical perspective informs the book's analysis: AI agent compatibility isn't introducing entirely new patterns. It's validating principles (semantic HTML, explicit state, structured data) that have worked across nearly five decades of content systems - from Superbase through BBC systems to modern platforms.

### Unique Position

**Both sides of the ecosystem:**

- Building websites that serve millions of users
- Developing tools that analyse those websites for agent compatibility
- Understanding both human and agent access patterns
- Bridging business requirements with technical implementation

**This dual perspective enables:**

- Practical implementation patterns validated through production use
- Understanding of both website owner and agent creator concerns
- Business case articulation for technical changes
- Technical depth accessible to business decision-makers
