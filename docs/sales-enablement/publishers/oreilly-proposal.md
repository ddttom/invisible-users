# O'Reilly Media Book Proposal

> **Status Note:** This material is maintained as reference for potential traditional publishing opportunities. Primary publishing strategy is independent (self-published via Amazon KDP and direct sales). Last updated: January 2026.

**To:** <authorreln@oreilly.com>
**From:** Tom Cranstoun
**Date:** January 2026
**Subject:** Book Proposal - "MX-Bible: Designing the Web for AI Agents and Everyone Else"

## Executive Summary

Between January 6-13, 2026, three major platforms (Google, Microsoft, Amazon) launched agent commerce infrastructure within seven days of each other. This convergence transformed AI agent compatibility from experimental technology to production infrastructure requirement.

I'm proposing **"MX-Bible"** - a complete, production-ready manuscript (465 pages, 13 chapters) that documents this shift and provides the implementation patterns required to adapt. The timing is critical: businesses are implementing agent-compatible patterns **now**, not in 12-18 months.

## The Market Timing Problem

**Standard O'Reilly timeline:** 12-18 months from proposal to publication

**Market reality:** Competitors are implementing agent compatibility **this quarter**

**The convergence window:** January 2026 convergence → Q2 2026 implementation surge → Q3 2026 becomes standard infrastructure

By Q3 2026, agent compatibility will be established practice. The book needs to reach decision-makers **during** the implementation surge (Q1-Q2 2026), not after.

## Proposed Fast-Track Approach

### Option 1: Immediate Early Release (Recommended)

**Timeline:**

- **Week 1-2:** Contract finalization
- **Week 3:** First 3 chapters live on O'Reilly Learning Platform
- **Weeks 4-8:** Rolling chapter releases (2-3 chapters per week)
- **Week 9:** Complete manuscript available to subscribers
- **Week 12:** Print edition available (if desired)

**Benefits:**

- O'Reilly Learning subscribers get immediate access
- Platform analytics show real-time engagement
- Corporate adoption visible within weeks
- Print edition follows proven demand

**Author concession:**

- Accept lower advance in exchange for speed
- Priority given to platform release over print
- Flexible on royalty structure for fast timeline

### Option 2: Print-First with Compressed Timeline

**Timeline:**

- **Week 1-2:** Contract finalization
- **Weeks 3-6:** Editorial review (manuscript complete, minimal editing needed)
- **Weeks 7-8:** Production (layout, cover, proofs)
- **Week 9:** Print-ready files
- **Week 12:** Books available

**Benefits:**

- Traditional print publication
- O'Reilly brand and distribution
- Retail presence (Amazon, bookstores)

**Challenges:**

- Still 3 months to market
- Less flexible than Early Release
- Misses peak urgency window (January-March 2026)

## Book Overview

### Title

"MX-Bible: Designing the Web for AI Agents and Everyone Else"

### Subtitle

Optimizing Websites for AI Agents and Human Users Through Better Structure

### Core Thesis

AI agents have achieved remarkable capabilities, but they need well-structured inputs to perform optimally. The patterns that optimize agent interaction - semantic HTML, explicit state management, structured data - are the same patterns that benefit human users with disabilities. This convergence creates compound value: solutions accessibility experts have recommended for years are now infrastructure requirements driven by commercial opportunity.

### Specifications

- **Length:** 465 pages (6"×9" format)
- **Word Count:** ~78,000 words core manuscript
- **Status:** Complete manuscript, ready for publication
- **Format:** 13 chapters + preface + glossary
- **Bonus Materials:** 12+ online appendices (~58,600 words) maintained by author
- **Code Examples:** Production-ready patterns for Apache, Nginx, Next.js, WordPress, Adobe EDS, static sites
- **Illustrations:** 13 custom SVG/PNG illustrations

### Target Audience

**Primary:**

- CTOs and engineering managers evaluating strategic priorities
- Software architects designing new systems
- Product managers planning roadmaps
- Senior developers leading implementation

**Secondary:**

- Business leaders understanding competitive implications
- UX designers considering agent experiences
- DevOps engineers implementing infrastructure
- Security teams evaluating agent access patterns

**Market Size:**

- O'Reilly Learning Platform subscribers (enterprise/professional audience)
- Technical decision-makers at e-commerce companies
- Enterprise CMS and digital experience practitioners
- Web performance and accessibility specialists

## Competitive Analysis

### Existing Titles

**Similar topics in O'Reilly catalog:**

- "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" (Kleppmann) - architectural patterns
- "Web Application Security" (Hoffman) - security considerations
- "Building Microservices" (Newman) - API-first architecture

**Key differentiators:**

1. **Timeliness:** Only book documenting January 2026 platform convergence
2. **Practical focus:** Production-ready code examples, not theoretical futures
3. **Convergence principle:** Demonstrates how agent-friendly patterns benefit all users
4. **Business + technical:** Bridges C-suite strategy with developer implementation
5. **Living content:** 12+ online appendices updated as field evolves

### Books from Other Publishers

- "AI Engineering" (Manning) - focuses on building agents, not website compatibility
- "Modern Web Development" (Packt) - doesn't address agent access patterns
- "Web Accessibility" (A Book Apart) - covers ARIA but not agent-specific patterns

**Market gap:** No comprehensive guide bridging business urgency, technical patterns, and production implementation for agent-compatible web design.

## Sample Content

### Chapter 2: The Invisible Failure (Excerpt)

> The booking agent visited the hotel website at 3:47 AM. It extracted available dates, compared prices across room types, and attempted to complete a reservation. The form validated successfully. The payment processed. The confirmation page loaded.
>
> But no booking existed in the hotel's system.
>
> The customer - who had delegated this task to their AI assistant - received a confirmation number that meant nothing. The hotel lost a legitimate booking. Traditional analytics showed a successful conversion. Everyone involved thought the transaction completed successfully.
>
> This invisible failure happened because the confirmation page displayed a dynamically-generated reference number that hadn't yet synchronized with the booking database. The delay - 2.3 seconds - was imperceptible to humans but catastrophic for agents that don't wait for asynchronous updates.

### Chapter 11: Designing for Both (Excerpt)

> The convergence principle is simple: what AI agents need is mostly what everyone needs.
>
> Explicit state attributes (`data-state="loading"`, `data-validation-state="error"`) help agents understand context. They also help screen readers, keyboard navigators, and mobile users with intermittent connectivity.
>
> Persistent error messages (that don't disappear after 3 seconds) allow agents to detect failure. They also help users with ADHD, cognitive processing differences, or anyone multitasking.
>
> Semantic HTML (`<article>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`) enables agent parsing. It also improves SEO, accessibility, and mobile performance.

## Next Steps

I'm available to discuss:

1. **Manuscript review:** Send complete manuscript for editorial evaluation
2. **Timeline feasibility:** What's O'Reilly's fastest possible path to market?
3. **Platform vs. print:** Which format serves this content best given timing urgency?
4. **Marketing collaboration:** How to maximize launch impact in Q1 2026

The January 2026 convergence created a narrow window where this book delivers maximum value. Businesses implementing agent compatibility **now** need guidance **now**. By Q3 2026, agent compatibility becomes established infrastructure and the opportunity shifts from "how to implement" to "how to optimize."

I believe O'Reilly's Early Release model is uniquely positioned to deliver timely content to the professional audience that needs it most urgently.

**This proposal represents a complete, production-ready manuscript that addresses an urgent market need. The question isn't whether this content will reach the market - it's whether O'Reilly can move fast enough to be the publisher that delivers it during the critical implementation window (Q1-Q2 2026).**

I'm eager to discuss how we can make this work within a timeline that serves both the market's urgency and O'Reilly's quality standards.
