# Janus Boye - MX + CMS Experts Community

**The hub of the global CMS community since 2003.**

---

## Why Janus Matters

Janus Boye doesn't just attend CMS events - he creates the spaces where the CMS industry thinks together.

- **CMS Experts** is the peer group where vendors, analysts, practitioners, and enterprise customers meet 3-4 times per year
- **CMS Kickoff** and **CMS Connect** are the vendor-neutral conferences where real discussions happen
- **His network** includes virtually everyone significant in the CMS/DXP space

**If MX is going to become an industry standard, it needs to be discussed in Janus's communities.**

## Janus's Profile

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Role** | Founder & Managing Director, Boye & Company |
| **Location** | Denmark (global operations in NA and Europe) |
| **Active Since** | 1998 (digital leadership), 2003 (Boye & Company) |
| **Consulting Clients** | UN, WHO, Red Bull, Nordea, Alfa Laval |
| **Approach** | Vendor-neutral, peer-driven, no sales pitches |

### What Boye & Company Does

> "We design and deliver peer groups and conferences to bring similarly motivated peers from different organisations together, and provide them with a professionally managed and coordinated network of colleagues who deal with similar types of projects, and similar kinds of challenges."

This is community building for CMS professionals. Not vendor marketing. Not analyst reports. Real peer connections.

### CMS Experts Group

The flagship community:

- Members from **every major CMS/DXP platform**
- **Vendors, consultants, and expert users** together
- **3-4 face-to-face meetings** per year (NA and Europe)
- **~12 virtual meetings** between in-person events
- **10+ year history** of trusted relationships

Deane Barker (10-year member): *"This is a small community of CMS professionals -- vendors, consultants, and expert users -- that meet face-to-face three times a year (for each geographic region), with about a dozen virtual calls/meetings in-between."*

### Conferences

- **CMS Kickoff** - Annual gathering (January 2026: St. Petersburg, Florida)
- **CMS Connect** - Mid-year conference
- **Regional events** - Vancouver, Aarhus, Philadelphia

All conferences are:
- Vendor-neutral
- No sales pitches
- Focused on peer learning and real discussions

## The MX Opportunity

### Why MX Fits Boye's Model

1. **Vendor-neutral** - MX is built on open standards (Schema.org, HTML5, ARIA), not proprietary technology
2. **Industry-wide relevance** - Every CMS vendor and user faces the AI discoverability challenge
3. **Peer discussion topic** - "How do we make our content AI-parseable?" is a question the community should be discussing
4. **No sales pitch** - MX is a pattern, not a product

### What Janus's Community Needs to Hear

The CMS industry is facing a shift:

- AI agents are becoming primary content consumers
- Most CMS-generated content is invisible to AI
- The platforms that solve this will win
- Open standards (MX patterns) can solve it without vendor lock-in

This is exactly the kind of strategic discussion CMS Experts should be having.

---

## Conversation Angles

### Angle 1: Community Topic

> "Janus, I've been working on something I think the CMS Experts community should be discussing: AI discoverability. Most CMS-generated content is invisible to AI agents - they can't parse unstructured HTML. There's a set of patterns - I'm calling it MX, Machine Experience - that makes content machine-readable using Schema.org and semantic HTML. It's vendor-neutral, standards-based. Seems like exactly the kind of thing your community should be exploring together."

### Angle 2: Conference Speaking

> "Would there be interest in a session at CMS Kickoff or CMS Connect on AI-ready content? Not a vendor pitch - a patterns discussion. What does it take to make CMS output parseable by Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity? The answer is surprisingly straightforward, and it applies to every platform. I could present the MX framework and lead a discussion on implementation approaches across different CMS platforms."

### Angle 3: Vendor-Neutral Standards

> "You've built your community on vendor-neutrality. MX is the same philosophy applied to AI discoverability. It's not Sitecore's approach or Adobe's approach - it's Schema.org, semantic HTML, open standards that work everywhere. The kind of industry baseline your community could help establish."

### Angle 4: Enterprise Advisory

> "You advise organisations like the UN and WHO on their digital presence. Are they thinking about AI agents as content consumers? Because their content - public health information, policy documents, guidance - is exactly what AI should be able to access and synthesise accurately. MX patterns could make that content globally distributable through AI intermediaries."

### Angle 5: The January 2026 Context

> "January 2026 saw Amazon, Microsoft, and Google all launch agent commerce systems within a week. This is becoming infrastructure. The CMS community needs to be ahead of this, not reacting to it. MX is the implementation framework that makes CMS content ready for this new reality."

---

## Specific Opportunities

### 1. CMS Experts Discussion Session

**Format:** 45-60 minute session at a CMS Experts meeting

**Topic:** "Making CMS Content AI-Discoverable: The MX Framework"

**Content:**
- Why AI agents can't parse most CMS output
- The MX patterns (Schema.org, semantic HTML, explicit state)
- Implementation approaches across platforms
- Open discussion: What are members seeing? What are vendors doing?

**Value for community:** Practical, vendor-neutral guidance on an emerging challenge

### 2. CMS Kickoff 26 Speaking Slot

**Format:** Conference session (January 2026, St. Petersburg)

**Topic options:**
- "The Invisible Users: AI Agents and Your CMS"
- "From UX to MX: Designing for Machine Experience"
- "Schema.org at Scale: Making Enterprise Content AI-Ready"

**Fit:** Vendor-neutral, strategic, actionable - matches Boye conference philosophy

### 3. CMS Connect Session

**Format:** Workshop or presentation

**Topic:** "MX Compliance Audit: Is Your CMS Output AI-Ready?"

**Interactive element:** Attendees analyse their own sites against MX criteria

### 4. Virtual CMS Experts Call

**Format:** 30-minute presentation + discussion on monthly call

**Topic:** "AI Discoverability: What CMS Professionals Need to Know"

**Lower barrier:** Test the topic before committing to in-person event

## Questions Janus Might Ask

### "Is this just another vendor trying to get access to my community?"

> "No. MX is a set of patterns built on open standards - Schema.org, HTML5, ARIA. I'm not selling software. I'm proposing that the CMS community needs to discuss AI discoverability, and I have a framework to structure that discussion. It's vendor-neutral by design."

### "What's your commercial interest here?"

> "I've written books on this and I'm building an MX community. Speaking at Boye events would raise awareness and credibility. But the content itself is freely available - I'm not gatekeeping patterns that the industry needs. Your community benefits from discussing this whether or not I'm involved."

### "How is this different from what CMS vendors are already doing?"

> "Most vendors are adding AI to their products - content generation, personalization, chatbots. That's AI inside the CMS. MX is about making CMS output visible to external AI - Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity. Different problem, complementary solution. And it needs to work across platforms, which is why open standards matter."

### "Is there proven demand from enterprises?"

> "The demand is emerging. When someone asks an AI 'recommend a digital experience platform' and your client doesn't appear, that's the demand signal. Most enterprises don't know they're invisible to AI yet. Your community is well-positioned to get ahead of this."

### "What would a session actually cover?"

> "Three parts: (1) Why AI agents can't parse typical CMS output - the gap between human-readable and machine-readable; (2) The MX patterns - Schema.org, semantic HTML, state exposure - with real examples; (3) Implementation approaches across different CMS platforms. Then discussion: what are members experiencing, what are vendors planning."

---

## Conversation Flow

### Opening

> "Janus, I wanted to run something by you. You've built the space where the CMS industry thinks together. I think there's a topic that community should be discussing that isn't getting systematic attention yet: AI discoverability."

### The Pitch (90 seconds)

> "AI agents are becoming primary content consumers. But most CMS-generated content is invisible to them - they can't parse unstructured HTML. There's a set of patterns that fixes this - Schema.org for typing, semantic HTML for structure, explicit state for dynamics. I'm calling it MX, Machine Experience.
>
> It's built entirely on open standards. Vendor-neutral. Works with any CMS. The kind of thing your community could help establish as an industry baseline.
>
> I'm wondering if this would be valuable as a CMS Experts discussion topic, or potentially a session at CMS Kickoff or Connect."

### The Ask

> "Would you be open to me presenting this to the community? Could be a virtual call first to test interest, or a full session at an in-person event. I'm not trying to sell anything - I think this is a discussion the community needs to have, and I have a framework to structure it."

Janus knows his community better than anyone. His feedback on positioning, timing, and format will be valuable.
