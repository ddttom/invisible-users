# Pre-Meeting Briefing

**Prepared for Janus Boye**

**From Tom Cranstoun**

**Date: January 2026**

---

## Purpose of This Document

This briefing provides context on a topic I believe the CMS community should be discussing systematically: **AI discoverability**. I'd like to explore how this might fit with CMS Experts programming.

---

## The Challenge for CMS Professionals

Every CMS platform faces the same emerging problem:

**AI agents are becoming a primary way users discover and interact with content.** But most CMS-generated content is invisible to them.

When someone asks Claude or ChatGPT "recommend a good headless CMS" or "find me a web design agency in Copenhagen," the AI synthesises its answer from content it can parse. Content it can't parse doesn't exist in that conversation.

**The CMS industry needs to address this. Systematically.**

---

## What's Happening

### The January 2026 Convergence

Within seven days in January 2026:

- **Amazon** launched Alexa+ (conversational commerce)
- **Microsoft** launched Copilot Checkout
- **Google** launched UCP + Shopping Agent

AI-mediated interaction moved from experiment to infrastructure. This affects every CMS vendor, agency, and enterprise customer.

### The Visibility Problem

Most CMS-generated content is:

- Optimised for human visual consumption
- Structured for presentation, not parsing
- Missing the metadata AI agents need
- Invisible to AI-assisted discovery

This is a universal challenge. It's not Sitecore's problem or Adobe's problem - it's everyone's problem.

## MX: A Framework for Discussion

I've been developing **MX (Machine Experience)** - a framework for making content AI-parseable.

### What MX Provides

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Patterns** | Schema.org, semantic HTML, state exposure |
| **Specification** | What "AI-ready content" actually means |
| **Implementation guidance** | How to apply patterns across platforms |
| **Audit methodology** | Testing content for AI readability |

### Built on Open Standards

MX isn't proprietary. It's built entirely on established standards:

- **Schema.org** - Structured data vocabulary
- **Semantic HTML** - Meaningful markup
- **ARIA** - Accessibility attributes
- **WCAG** - Accessibility guidelines

Vendor-neutral by design. Works with any CMS.

---

## Why This Fits CMS Experts

Your community values:

| CMS Experts Principle | MX Alignment |
|----------------------|--------------|
| Vendor-neutral discussion | Open standards, no platform lock-in |
| Peer-driven insights | Shared challenge across all platforms |
| Actionable takeaways | Concrete implementation patterns |
| No sales pitches | Framework discussion, not product |

**AI discoverability is exactly the kind of strategic topic your community should be exploring together.**

---

## The Three Pillars

MX addresses three interconnected challenges:

### 1. Reducing Hallucination

When AI encounters ambiguous CMS content, it guesses. Guesses become hallucinations - fabricated product details, invented business hours, incorrect specifications.

**Structured data eliminates guesswork.** Explicit metadata means accurate representation.

### 2. Distributing Knowledge

CMS-managed content represents significant organisational knowledge. Unstructured, it's trapped. Structured, it can be synthesised and distributed globally through AI intermediaries.

### 3. Improving Efficiency

AI inference is computationally expensive. Structured content reduces processing overhead. At enterprise scale, this matters for both cost and sustainability.

---

## What I've Developed

**Two books (publication-ready):**

- **MX-Bible** - Comprehensive guide (78,000+ words)
- **MX-Handbook** - Practical implementation for developers

**Supporting materials:**

- CMS-specific compliance specifications
- Web audit tool for AI readability testing
- Code examples across platforms

---

## Potential Opportunities

### For CMS Experts Community

**Option 1: Discussion Session**

A 45-60 minute session at a CMS Experts meeting:

- Why AI agents can't parse most CMS output
- The MX patterns (what they are, how they work)
- Implementation approaches across platforms
- Open discussion: What are members experiencing?

**Option 2: Virtual Call**

A 30-minute presentation on a monthly community call to test interest before committing to an in-person session.

### For Conferences

**CMS Kickoff or CMS Connect session:**

- "The Invisible Users: AI Agents and Your CMS"
- "From UX to MX: Designing for Machine Experience"
- "Making Enterprise Content AI-Ready"

Vendor-neutral, strategic, actionable - matching Boye conference philosophy.

---

## What I'd Offer

### Content

- Speaking at events/sessions
- Written guides for CMS Experts members
- MX compliance specification for CMS platforms
- Audit methodology documentation

### Expertise

- Understanding of AI agent behaviour
- Implementation patterns across CMS platforms
- Technical depth without vendor bias

### Discussion Framework

- Structured approach to a topic many are encountering ad hoc
- Vocabulary for discussing AI readiness
- Evaluation criteria for CMS platforms

## Questions You Might Have

**"Is this just another vendor trying to access my community?"**

No. MX is a pattern framework built on open standards. I'm not selling software. I'm proposing that the CMS community needs to discuss AI discoverability, and I have a framework to structure that discussion.

**"What's your commercial interest?"**

I've written books on this and I'm building an MX community. Speaking at Boye events would raise awareness. But the patterns are freely available - I'm not gatekeeping what the industry needs.

**"How is this different from what vendors are already doing?"**

Most vendors are adding AI *into* their products (content generation, chatbots). MX addresses making CMS *output* visible to external AI. Different problem, complementary solution.

**"Is there enterprise demand?"**

Emerging. When someone asks AI "recommend a DXP" and your client doesn't appear, that's the demand signal. Most enterprises don't know they're invisible to AI yet.

---

## The Conversation

When we meet, I'd like to:

1. Share more detail on the MX framework
2. Hear your perspective on industry readiness
3. Discuss whether/how this fits CMS Experts programming
4. Get your input on positioning for enterprise CMS buyers

Your insight into what the community needs is valuable. I'm as interested in your perspective as in presenting mine.

AI discoverability is coming to CMS whether the industry prepares or not. I believe your community is well-positioned to lead that conversation.

I appreciate you taking time to consider this.
