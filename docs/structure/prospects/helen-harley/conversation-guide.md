# Conversation Guide - Helen

Talking points for discussing MX community membership. Not a script - use naturally as the conversation flows.

---

## Opening (Warm Up)

- Catch up genuinely first - this isn't a sales call
- When transitioning: "There's something I wanted to run by you - a project I've been working on..."

---

## The Core Pitch (2 Minutes)

**If she hasn't read the invitation document:**

> "So, here's the thing. The web is changing. AI assistants - Claude, ChatGPT, all of them - are now visiting websites trying to understand content. But most websites are invisible to them because they're built for human eyes, not machine parsing.
>
> I've been working on something called MX - Machine Experience. It's a set of patterns that make websites understandable to AI. Schema.org markup, semantic HTML, that kind of thing.
>
> The interesting bit: these same patterns also improve accessibility. What helps machines also helps people with disabilities. It's a genuine convergence.
>
> I've written two books, built tools, created documentation. Now I'm building a community of people who get this and want to help others implement it."

**If she has read it:**

> "So you've seen the document - what questions came up? What made sense, what didn't?"

Let her lead from there.

---

## Why Her (Be Specific)

> "Here's why I thought of you specifically:
>
> One - you do both design and development. MX isn't just code, it's thinking about machine audiences alongside human audiences. You get that duality.
>
> Two - you write documentation that actual humans can understand. That's rare and valuable. The MX concepts aren't complicated, but they need explaining well.
>
> Three - you've spent twenty years in media and broadcasting. Content distribution is what this is about - making sure content reaches audiences, including AI audiences.
>
> I'm not just looking for developers. I need people who can communicate clearly and think about the whole picture."

## What You're Actually Asking

Be clear and specific:

> "I'm asking if you'd be interested in being a founding member of the MX community. Part-time, flexible, voluntary during the launch phase.
>
> What that means practically:
>
> - Access to all the materials - books, tools, documentation
> - Input on how this develops - your perspective matters
> - Contributing when you can - reviewing docs, answering questions, helping explain concepts
> - No fixed commitment - some weeks might be a few hours, some weeks nothing
>
> It's not a job. There's no salary right now. If this generates revenue later, founding members would be first considered for paid work, but that's speculative."

---

## Handling Questions

### "What's the time commitment really?"

> "Honestly flexible. I'd rather you contribute occasionally and stay engaged than burn out trying to do too much. Some weeks you might spend an hour reading and commenting. Others, nothing. During busy periods like launches, more involvement would be valuable but never required."

### "Do I need to learn a lot of technical stuff?"

> "Some technical concepts, yes - Schema.org markup, semantic HTML basics. But you don't need to become a developer. The community needs people who can explain things clearly as much as people who can code. Your documentation skills are genuinely valuable."

### "Is this going to make money?"

> "Not yet, and maybe not for a while. Right now it's investment - time and effort building something. The goal is for MX to become a standard approach, which could generate consulting, training, or licensing revenue. But I can't promise that timeline or guarantee it happens. Don't join expecting income."

### "What if I try it and it's not for me?"

> "Then you step back, no problem. This isn't a contract. We're friends - that matters more than any project. Try it, see if it fits, and if it doesn't, just tell me."

### "Why now? Why the urgency?"

> "January 2026 was a turning point. Amazon, Microsoft, and Google all launched AI commerce systems within a week of each other. This went from experimental to infrastructure. The window to establish good patterns before the market fragments is narrowing. But honestly, if you need time to decide, take it. Better a good decision than a rushed one."

## The Honest Bits

Don't oversell. Include these:

> "I should be honest about what's uncertain:
>
> - Market timing is unpredictable. We believe this is becoming essential, but adoption could be slow.
> - The community is starting from scratch. Growth depends on delivering real value.
> - Revenue model isn't figured out yet. This is currently all investment, no return.
>
> What I'm confident about:
>
> - The technical foundation is solid - Schema.org, semantic HTML, these are established standards.
> - The trend is real - AI agent adoption is accelerating.
> - The materials exist - two books, working tools, comprehensive documentation.
>
> I can't promise this becomes significant. I can promise it's interesting and that your contributions would matter."

---

## If She's Interested

> "Great. Let me get you access to the repositories so you can explore. Maybe start with the MX-Bible README and the 'MX: The Idea' folder - that gives you the philosophical foundation.
>
> No pressure to dive deep immediately. Browse when you have time, and we can talk again once you've had a chance to look around."

**Practical next steps:**
- Add her to relevant repositories
- Send direct links to key starting documents
- Schedule a follow-up conversation in 1-2 weeks

---

## If She's Uncertain

> "That's completely fair. Take whatever time you need. I can send you more materials to read, or we can talk again after you've thought about it. There's no deadline here."

**Don't push.** Let her process.

---

## If She Declines

> "No problem at all. I appreciate you hearing me out. If anything changes or if you want to revisit this later, the door's always open. Now, let's [change subject / catch up about something else]..."

**Key:** Accept gracefully. Don't try to overcome objections. Friendship first.

---

## Things NOT to Say

- "This is going to be huge" (speculative, sounds like hype)
- "You'd be missing out" (pressure tactic)
- "Everyone's joining" (false urgency)
- "Just try it for a month" (minimising commitment)
- Anything that sounds like a sales pitch

---

## Things TO Emphasise

- Her specific skills and why they matter
- The flexibility of involvement
- Your friendship being more important than recruitment
- Honest uncertainties alongside genuine opportunities
- No pressure, no obligation, no strings

---

## Closing

However the conversation goes:

> "Thanks for listening and considering it. Whatever you decide is fine. Let's [make plans to catch up again / continue with whatever else you were doing]."

End as friends, regardless of outcome.
