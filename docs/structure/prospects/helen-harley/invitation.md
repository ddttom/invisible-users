# Helen Harley - MX Community Invitation

**A comprehensive briefing for a friend.**

This document provides everything Helen needs to understand MX and decide whether to join the community during the launch phase.

## Part 1: What MX Actually Is

### The One-Sentence Version

MX (Machine Experience) is a set of patterns that make websites understandable to AI assistants - so when someone asks Claude or ChatGPT "find me a good web designer," sites that follow MX principles actually appear in the answer.

### The Longer Version

For thirty years, we've built websites for human eyes. Styled text, images, layouts - all optimised for visual consumption.

Now AI agents are visiting these sites. Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity, Copilot - they're trying to understand web content to answer user questions. But they can't. The web is largely illegible to them.

**The result:**

- Businesses are invisible to AI-assisted discovery
- AI hallucinates (makes up facts) when it can't find clear data
- Users get unreliable information
- Everyone loses

**MX fixes this** by adding structured metadata that AI can parse directly:

- Schema.org markup (standardised data formats)
- Semantic HTML (meaningful structure)
- Explicit state attributes (clear indication of what's happening)
- Machine-readable content (no guesswork required)

**The remarkable thing:** These same patterns also improve accessibility for people with disabilities. The convergence principle - what helps machines also helps humans.

### Why This Matters Now

In January 2026, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google all launched AI agent commerce systems within seven days of each other. AI-mediated interaction is becoming infrastructure, not novelty.

Websites that AI can understand will be recommended, discovered, acted upon. Websites that AI can't understand will be invisible.

**This is the shift from UX (User Experience) to MX (Machine Experience).**

## Part 2: The Project

### What Exists

**Two books (publication-ready):**

1. **MX-Bible** - The comprehensive guide (~78,000 words, 13 chapters)
   - Full explanation of AI agents and web interaction
   - Technical patterns and implementation guidance
   - Business case and strategic context

2. **MX-Handbook** - The practical implementation guide (11 chapters)
   - Developer and designer focused
   - Step-by-step implementation
   - Code examples and patterns

**Supporting materials:**

- Shared appendices (12 detailed reference documents)
- Code examples repository (good vs bad patterns)
- Web audit tool (analyses sites for MX compliance)
- Compliance specifications (CMS, markdown, HTML, CSS, JS)
- Prospect outreach templates

### What's Launching

The MX community - a group of practitioners who:

- Understand MX principles
- Implement them in their work
- Help others understand the shift
- Contribute to the growing body of knowledge

**The goal:** Establish MX as the standard approach for AI-compatible web development before the market fragments into proprietary solutions.

## Part 3: Why You, Helen

Your background is remarkably well-suited:

### 1. Web Design + Development

You understand both the creative and technical sides of web work. MX isn't just code - it's design thinking about machine audiences alongside human audiences.

### 2. Technical Documentation

You're known for writing documentation that "Average Joe" can understand. The MX community desperately needs this skill. The concepts aren't complicated, but they need clear explanation for different audiences (developers, designers, business owners, marketers).

### 3. Media/Broadcasting Background

You've worked in industries where content distribution matters. MX is fundamentally about content distribution - ensuring content reaches audiences (including AI audiences) effectively.

### 4. Project Management

Launching a community requires coordination, planning, and execution. Your PM experience is directly applicable.

### 5. Client-Facing Experience

You've helped clients "regularly update with news and articles" and set up their digital presence. Many MX community members will need exactly this kind of practical guidance.

## Part 4: The Invitation

### What I'm Asking

Join the MX community as a **part-time founding member** during the launch phase.

### What "Part-Time" Means

- **Not a job.** No fixed hours, no employment relationship.
- **Flexible involvement.** Contribute when you can, step back when you can't.
- **Your expertise, your schedule.** Share what you know, learn what interests you.

### What "Founding Member" Means

- **Early access** to all materials, discussions, and developments
- **Input on direction** - your perspective shapes how this grows
- **Recognition** as a founding contributor when this scales
- **Network** with others thinking about AI-compatible web development

### What You'd Actually Do

Options based on interest and availability:

**Content contribution:**
- Review and improve documentation clarity
- Write practical guides for specific audiences
- Create examples from your own experience

**Community building:**
- Welcome new members
- Answer questions in discussions
- Connect people with relevant expertise

**Quality assurance:**
- Test the web audit tool on real sites
- Review compliance specifications for clarity
- Identify gaps in the materials

**Outreach:**
- Help explain MX to your network
- Introduce potential community members
- Represent MX at relevant events (if interested)

**You don't have to do all of these.** Pick what interests you. Do as much or as little as works.

## Part 5: What You'd Learn

Being involved exposes you to:

### Technical Knowledge

- Schema.org structured data (industry standard, broadly applicable)
- Semantic HTML best practices
- Accessibility patterns (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- AI agent behaviour and capabilities

### Industry Insight

- How major platforms (Google, Amazon, Microsoft) are approaching AI commerce
- The convergence of accessibility and AI optimisation
- Where web development is heading

### Network

- Other practitioners thinking about these problems
- Potential collaborators and clients
- Early visibility in an emerging field

---

## Part 6: The Honest Assessment

### What's Uncertain

- **Market timing:** We believe MX is becoming essential, but adoption timelines are unpredictable
- **Community growth:** We're starting from scratch - growth depends on value delivered
- **Revenue model:** Currently this is investment, not income - future models TBD

### What's Solid

- **The technical foundation:** Schema.org, semantic HTML, WCAG - these are established standards, not speculation
- **The trend:** AI agent adoption is accelerating, not slowing
- **The materials:** Two publication-ready books, working tools, comprehensive documentation

### What I Can't Promise

- That this becomes a significant income source (it might, but that's not the ask)
- That the timing is perfect (it might be early, it might be exactly right)
- That it won't require real effort (learning new concepts always does)

### What I Can Promise

- Honest communication about what's working and what isn't
- Flexibility about your involvement level
- Recognition of your contributions
- An interesting intellectual challenge

## Part 7: The Three Pillars (Quick Version)

MX delivers three interconnected benefits:

### 1. Reduces Hallucination

When AI encounters ambiguous content, it guesses. Guesses become hallucinations. Structured data eliminates guessing.

**Example:** Instead of AI inferring your business hours from scattered text, Schema.org `OpeningHoursSpecification` states them explicitly. No inference, no error.

### 2. Distributes Knowledge

Unstructured content is trapped - accessible only to humans who can read that language, use that interface, parse that format. Structured content flows globally through AI intermediaries.

**Example:** A farmer in Kenya asks an AI about crop techniques. The AI synthesises from structured agricultural content worldwide, delivers in Swahili. Knowledge distribution without translation bottlenecks.

### 3. Reduces Energy

AI inference is computationally expensive. Every ambiguity requires processing. Structured data reduces inference, reduces computation, reduces energy consumption at scale.

**Example:** Parsing explicit JSON-LD takes a fraction of the energy required to interpret ambiguous prose. At billions of queries, this matters environmentally.

## Part 8: Practical Examples

### Before MX

```html
<div class="business-info">
  <h2>Smith's Bakery</h2>
  <p>Open Monday to Saturday, 8am-6pm</p>
  <p>Call us: 020 7123 4567</p>
</div>
```

AI must infer: Is this a business? What type? Are those hours current? Is the phone number for orders or enquiries?

### After MX

```html
<div itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Bakery">
  <h2 itemprop="name">Smith's Bakery</h2>
  <div itemprop="openingHoursSpecification" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/OpeningHoursSpecification">
    <meta itemprop="dayOfWeek" content="Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday">
    <meta itemprop="opens" content="08:00">
    <meta itemprop="closes" content="18:00">
    <p>Open Monday to Saturday, 8am-6pm</p>
  </div>
  <p itemprop="telephone">020 7123 4567</p>
</div>
```

AI knows exactly: This is a bakery, these are the hours, this is the phone number. No inference required.

**The human sees the same thing. The machine finally understands it.**

## Part 9: Questions You Might Have

### "Do I need to be technical?"

Some technical comfort helps, but no - the community needs people who can explain concepts clearly, not just people who can write code. Your documentation skills are as valuable as any developer's coding skills.

### "How much time are we talking?"

Genuinely flexible. Some weeks might be a few hours of reading and commenting. Other weeks might be nothing. During active periods (launches, events), more involvement would be valuable but never required.

### "Is there money involved?"

Not initially. This is voluntary involvement during the launch phase. If MX generates revenue (consulting, training, licensing), founding members would be considered for paid opportunities. But that's speculative - don't join expecting income.

### "What if I start and it's not for me?"

No problem. This isn't a contract. Try it, and if it doesn't fit, step back gracefully. No hard feelings, no obligations.

### "What do you need from me to decide?"

Ideally:
1. Read this document
2. Skim the MX-Bible README and a chapter or two (I can send links)
3. Let's have a conversation - your questions will help me understand what's unclear
4. Decide based on whether it sounds interesting and feasible

### "Why are you doing this?"

I believe the web is about to fundamentally change. AI agents will become a primary way people interact with online content. The sites that adapt will thrive. The sites that don't will become invisible.

I want to help people adapt. And I think the best way to do that is to build a community of practitioners who understand these patterns and can help others implement them.

## Part 10: Next Steps

### If You're Interested

Let's talk. Not a pitch meeting - a conversation between friends about whether this is something you'd find worthwhile.

I can:
- Walk you through the materials in more detail
- Answer questions this document doesn't cover
- Discuss what involvement might look like specifically for you
- Share access to the repositories so you can explore

### If You're Not Sure

That's completely fine. Take time. Read more if you want (I'll send links). There's no deadline, no pressure, no urgency that overrides making a good decision.

### If It's Not For You

Also fine. I value our friendship more than any project. If this doesn't fit your interests, priorities, or capacity right now, I'd rather know that than have you join out of obligation.
