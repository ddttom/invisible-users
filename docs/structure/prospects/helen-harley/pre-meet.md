# Pre-Meeting Briefing

**Prepared for Helen Harley**

**From Tom Cranstoun**

**Date: January 2026**

---

## Purpose of This Document

This briefing provides background on a project I'd like to discuss with you. The goal is to give you enough context to decide whether you'd like to explore involvement further - no pressure, just information.

---

## The Short Version

I've been working on something called **MX (Machine Experience)** - a set of patterns that make websites understandable to AI assistants like Claude and ChatGPT.

I'm building a community of practitioners around it, and I think your skills would be valuable. I'd like to invite you to join as a founding member.

---

## What's Happening with the Web

For thirty years, we've built websites for human eyes. Now AI agents are visiting these sites, trying to understand content to answer user questions.

**The problem:** Most websites are invisible to AI. They can't parse unstructured content.

**The result:**

- Businesses don't appear in AI-assisted discovery
- AI makes up facts when it can't find clear data
- Users get unreliable information

**Example:** When someone asks an AI "What are the opening hours for Smith's Bakery?", the AI often guesses because the information isn't structured in a way it can reliably parse.

---

## What MX Does

MX (Machine Experience) adds structure to web content so AI can understand it:

| Human-Readable | Machine-Readable |
|---------------|-----------------|
| "Open Mon-Sat, 8am-6pm" | Schema.org OpeningHoursSpecification |
| "£99" | Explicit price with currency |
| "Call us" | ContactPoint with defined method |

**The key insight:** The same patterns that help AI also help people with disabilities (screen readers, keyboard navigation). It's a convergence - improving for one audience improves for both.

---

## Why This Matters Now

In January 2026, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google all launched AI shopping assistants within seven days of each other. AI-mediated interaction is becoming infrastructure.

Websites that AI can understand will be discovered and recommended. Websites that AI can't understand will be invisible.

---

## What I've Built

**Two books (ready for publication):**

- **MX-Bible** - Comprehensive guide (78,000+ words, 13 chapters)
- **MX-Handbook** - Practical implementation guide (11 chapters)

**Supporting materials:**

- 12 detailed appendices
- Code examples showing good vs bad patterns
- Web audit tool that analyses sites for MX compliance
- Compliance specifications

---

## The Community

I'm building a community of people who:

- Understand MX principles
- Implement them in their work
- Help others understand the shift

**The goal:** Establish MX as the standard approach before the market fragments into competing proprietary solutions.

---

## Why You

Your background fits remarkably well:

| Your Experience | MX Community Need |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Web design + development | Understanding both creative and technical sides |
| Technical documentation | Explaining concepts clearly to different audiences |
| Media/broadcasting | Content distribution expertise |
| Project management | Community coordination |
| Client-facing work | Practical guidance for businesses |

Your ability to write documentation that "Average Joe" can understand is exactly what the MX community needs.

---

## The Invitation

**Part-time founding member** during the MX community launch phase.

**What it means:**

- Not a job - no fixed hours, no employment relationship
- Flexible involvement - contribute when you can
- Early access to all materials
- Input on direction as the community grows
- Recognition as a founding contributor

**What you might do (based on interest):**

- Review documentation for clarity
- Help answer community questions
- Test tools on real sites
- Write practical guides
- Connect with others in the space

**No obligation to do everything.** Pick what interests you.

---

## What's In It For You

**Learning opportunities:**

- Schema.org structured data (industry standard)
- AI agent behaviour and capabilities
- Where web development is heading
- Accessibility patterns (WCAG 2.1 AA)

**Network:**

- Other practitioners thinking about these problems
- Potential collaborators
- Early visibility in an emerging field

---

## The Honest Assessment

**What's uncertain:**

- Market timing - adoption timelines are unpredictable
- Community growth - we're starting from scratch
- Revenue model - currently investment, not income

**What's solid:**

- Technical foundation - Schema.org, semantic HTML, ARIA are established standards
- The trend - AI agent adoption is accelerating
- The materials - publication-ready books, working tools

**What I can't promise:**

- That this becomes significant income (it might, but that's not the ask)
- Perfect timing
- Zero effort required

**What I can promise:**

- Honest communication
- Flexibility about your involvement
- Recognition of contributions
- An interesting intellectual challenge

---

## The Ask

I'm asking if you'd be interested in joining the MX community as a founding member.

This isn't a contract. If you try it and it's not for you, step back gracefully - no hard feelings.

---

## Before We Meet

You don't need to prepare anything. But if you're curious, you might think about:

- Does the MX concept make sense to you?
- Are there aspects you'd want to understand better?
- What kind of involvement would fit your situation?

---

## The Conversation

When we meet, I'd like to:

1. Answer any questions this document raises
2. Hear your perspective on the concept
3. Discuss what involvement might look like
4. Let you decide without pressure

Our friendship matters more than any project. Whatever you decide is fine.
