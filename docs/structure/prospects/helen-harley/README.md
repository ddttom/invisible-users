- Contribute based on interest and availability
- Options: content review, documentation, community building, outreach
- Recognition as founding contributor

## Approach

1. Share `invitation.md` (or summarise key points)
2. Give time to read/absorb
3. Have conversation using `conversation-guide.md`

5. Accept any answer gracefully
