Hi Petr,

I've been following Kentico's AI investments - AIRA and KentiCopilot are exactly the right moves for content creation. But I wanted to raise the complementary challenge: content discoverability by external AI agents.

When someone asks Claude or ChatGPT "find a good e-commerce platform" or "recommend a hotel in Prague," do Kentico-powered sites appear?

For most DXP sites, the answer is no. External AI agents can't parse unstructured web content - they need explicit metadata patterns.

This is what MX compliance addresses. It's a set of structured data patterns (Schema.org, semantic HTML, explicit state) that make Xperience-powered sites discoverable by AI assistants.

The opportunity for Kentico:
- **Platform differentiation:** "AI-discoverable sites" as a native capability
- **Partner value:** 1,000+ agencies can offer AI-readiness as a service
- **Customer outcomes:** Sites that appear in AI-assisted discovery

The architecture fits naturally with Xperience's content model - mostly template-level metadata generation.

Worth a 20-minute conversation?

Hi Petr,

Following up on MX compliance for Kentico.

I've been thinking about how it maps to Xperience's architecture:

**Current Kentico AI (internal):**
- AIRA helps marketers create content
- KentiCopilot assists with platform tasks

**MX compliance (external):**
- Makes published content parseable by Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity
- Enables AI-assisted discovery of Kentico-powered sites

The implementation sits at the page template layer:
- Schema.org JSON-LD generation based on content type
- MX meta tags for content classification
- Semantic HTML structure (Xperience likely does much of this already)

For your 1,000+ agency partners, it's a value-add service: "We'll make your site AI-discoverable."

Happy to walk through the technical patterns if useful.

Tom

P.S. I'd be happy to include Dominik in the conversation if that makes sense from an execution perspective.

## LinkedIn Connection Request

### Connection Note

```text
Hi Petr - I work on AI agent discoverability standards for web platforms. Given Kentico's investments in AIRA and KentiCopilot, thought you might be interested in the complementary challenge: making Kentico-powered sites visible to external AI agents. Happy to share the patterns.
```

### Follow-up Message

```text
Thanks for connecting!

Quick context: You've built excellent AI for content creation (AIRA, KentiCopilot). MX compliance addresses the other side: making that content discoverable by external AI assistants.

When someone asks an AI "find an e-commerce site" or "recommend a business," do Kentico-powered sites appear? For most, the answer is no - external agents can't parse unstructured content.

The fix integrates naturally with Xperience's architecture. Worth a quick chat?

## Executive Brief for Petr

### The Opportunity

Kentico has invested wisely in AI for content creation. The complementary opportunity is content discoverability - ensuring the content your customers create is visible to external AI agents.

### Market Context

AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity, Copilot) are becoming a primary discovery channel. Users ask: "Find me a good restaurant in Berlin," "Recommend an e-commerce platform," "What hotels are near the conference centre?"

Most websites - including most Kentico-powered sites - are invisible to these queries. The AI can't parse unstructured web content.

### The Solution

MX (Machine Experience) compliance is a set of metadata patterns that make web content AI-parseable:
- Schema.org JSON-LD for content typing
- Semantic HTML for structure
- Explicit state attributes for dynamic content

### Why This Fits Kentico

1. **Complements your AI investment:** AIRA creates content, MX compliance makes it discoverable
2. **Platform-level implementation:** Template-based generation, not user complexity
3. **Partner value multiplier:** 1,000+ agencies can offer AI-discoverability services
4. **Competitive differentiation:** "AI-discoverable sites" as a Xperience feature

### Investment

- Architecture review: 1 week
- Template implementation: 2-4 weeks
- Partner enablement: Ongoing

### Outcome

Kentico-powered sites that appear when AI assistants make recommendations - a growing discovery channel that most competitors are ignoring.

## Partner Network Angle

### Email to Partner Team (via Petr)

```text
Hi Petr,

One angle I wanted to highlight: your 1,000+ agency partners.

If Kentico implements MX compliance at the platform level, every partner can offer "AI-discoverable websites" to their clients. It becomes:

- A new service offering for agencies
- A differentiation point vs. WordPress/Drupal shops
- A measurable client outcome (test with AI assistants before/after)

The implementation work happens once at Kentico's template level. Partners get the capability automatically for every Xperience project.

Worth discussing how to position this for the partner network?

Tom

## Technical Brief (for Dominik/Engineering)

### MX Compliance for Xperience by Kentico

**The Problem:**
External AI agents (Claude, ChatGPT, browser agents) can't parse most DXP-generated content. They need explicit structure.

**The Solution:**
Template-level metadata generation that makes Xperience output AI-parseable.

**Implementation Scope:**

1. **Page Template Enhancement**
   - Generate Schema.org JSON-LD based on content type
   - Add MX meta tags (`<meta name="mx-compliant" content="true">`)
   - Ensure semantic HTML structure (proper headings, landmarks)

2. **Content Type Mapping**
   - Map Xperience content types to Schema.org types
   - Article → Article, Product → Product, Event → Event, etc.
   - Auto-generate structured data from content fields

3. **Widget/Component Updates**
   - Add `data-*` attributes for interactive state
   - Ensure ARIA compliance for dynamic components
   - Explicit state exposure (loading, error, success)

4. **Content Editor UX**
   - MX metadata fields (optional override of auto-generated)
   - AI-discoverability preview/test
   - Compliance indicator in content dashboard

**Architecture Fit:**
Xperience's content model already separates content from presentation. MX compliance adds a metadata layer at the presentation tier - minimal content model changes required.

**Estimated Effort:**
- Phase 1 (Core templates): 4-6 weeks
- Phase 2 (Content type mapping): 2-4 weeks
- Phase 3 (Editor UX): 2-4 weeks

## Objection Handling

### "We already have AI with AIRA"

```text
Absolutely - AIRA is excellent for content creation. MX compliance addresses
the complementary challenge: content discoverability by external AI agents.

Think of it as:
- AIRA: AI that helps your customers CREATE content
- MX: Patterns that help external AI FIND that content

They're two halves of the AI story for a DXP.
```

### "Our customers haven't asked for this"

```text
They may not know to ask. Try this test: ask Claude or ChatGPT to recommend
businesses in your customers' industries. How many Kentico-powered sites appear?

For most, the answer is zero - but the customer doesn't know they're invisible
to AI discovery. This is a platform-led capability, like responsive design was
in 2012.
```

### "How does this affect our roadmap?"

```text
MX compliance is primarily template-level changes - it doesn't compete with
feature development. The content model and editor experience stay largely
unchanged.

It's more like a capability layer: implement once, benefit across all Xperience
deployments.
```

### "What's the ROI?"

```text
AI-assisted discovery is a growing channel. The direct ROI is site traffic and
conversions from AI recommendations.

But the strategic value is platform differentiation: "Kentico sites are
AI-discoverable" vs. competitors where they're not.

For your partner network, it's a new service offering: AI-readiness audits and
implementation for existing clients.
```

## Event Opportunity

### Workshop Proposal

```text
Hi Petr,

Would Kentico be interested in co-hosting a workshop for your agency partners
on AI-discoverable websites?

Format: 90-minute session covering:
- Why AI agents can't find most websites
- MX compliance patterns (Schema.org, semantic HTML, state)
- Xperience-specific implementation
- How partners can offer AI-readiness as a service

Outcomes for Kentico:
- Partner engagement and enablement
- Differentiation messaging ("AI-discoverable DXP")
- Content for Kentico Connection or partner events

Happy to discuss format and timing.

Tom
```
