## Strategic Positioning

Kentico has invested heavily in AI for content **creation** (AIRA, KentiCopilot). MX compliance addresses the complementary challenge: content **discoverability** by external AI agents.

**Key message:** MX compliance complements, not competes with, Kentico's AI investments.

## Angles to Emphasise

1. **Complement existing AI:** AIRA creates content, MX makes it discoverable
2. **Platform-level implementation:** Template changes, not user complexity
3. **Partner network multiplier:** 1,000+ agencies can offer AI-readiness services
4. **Competitive differentiation:** First DXP with native AI-discoverability
5. **Customer outcomes:** Sites that appear in AI-assisted recommendations

## Usage

Use the templates in `petr-palas.md` as starting points. Personalise based on:
- Recent Kentico announcements
- Specific product updates
- Conference or event timing
- Partner programme developments

## Adding More Contacts

To add outreach for additional Kentico contacts (e.g., Dominik Pinter, product leaders, partner team):

1. Create new file: `[firstname-lastname].md`
2. Include YAML frontmatter with prospect details
3. Tailor messaging to their role and priorities
4. Reference `petr-palas.md` for format consistency
