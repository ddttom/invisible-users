  This is a pre-meeting briefing document designed to be converted to PDF
  for sharing with Matt before a meeting. Focus is on the conceptual alignment
  between Agent Experience (AX) which Matt coined and MX (Machine Experience)
  which provides implementation patterns for AX.

# Pre-Meeting Briefing

**Prepared for Matt Garrepy**

**From Tom Cranstoun**

**Date: January 2026**

---

## Purpose of This Document

This briefing connects two ideas: **Agent Experience (AX)** - which you coined - and **MX (Machine Experience)** - which I've been developing.

I believe they're complementary. AX is the "why." MX is the "how."

---

## The Connection

### Your Concept: Agent Experience (AX)

You've articulated that AI agents interacting with digital experiences deserve the same design consideration as human users. "Agent Experience" became an undercurrent at The Composable Conference.

**AX asks:** How should we think about agents as users?

### My Framework: Machine Experience (MX)

I've been developing the implementation patterns that make AX achievable:

- Schema.org structured data for content typing
- Semantic HTML for parseable structure
- Explicit state attributes for dynamic content
- Machine-readable metadata for AI discoverability

**MX answers:** Here's how to build for them.

### The Synthesis

| AX (Concept) | MX (Implementation) |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Agents need designed experiences | Here are the design patterns |
| Content should be agent-readable | Schema.org + semantic HTML |
| State should be explicit | data-* attributes + ARIA |
| Discovery should work | MX metadata + llms.txt |

**You identified the need. MX provides the toolkit.**

## What I've Developed

### Two Books (Publication-Ready)

**MX-Bible** - Comprehensive guide (78,000+ words, 13 chapters)

- Full explanation of AI agents and web interaction
- Technical patterns and implementation guidance
- Business case and strategic context

**MX-Handbook** - Practical implementation (11 chapters)

- Developer and designer focused
- Step-by-step implementation
- Code examples and patterns

### Supporting Materials

- 12 detailed appendices
- Code examples (good vs bad patterns)
- Web audit tool for MX compliance testing
- CMS compliance specifications

---

## The Three Pillars

MX delivers three interconnected benefits:

### 1. Hallucination Reduction

When AI encounters ambiguous content, it guesses. Guesses become hallucinations.

**MX solution:** Structured, verifiable metadata eliminates guesswork. Explicit data means AI doesn't need to infer, so inference errors disappear.

### 2. Knowledge Distribution

Most content is trapped in formats AI can't parse.

**MX solution:** Machine-parseable content enables global distribution through AI intermediaries. Structured content reaches users in any language, through any interface.

### 3. Energy Efficiency

AI inference is computationally expensive.

**MX solution:** Explicit data reduces inference overhead. At scale, this matters for both cost and sustainability.

## The January 2026 Context

Within seven days:

- **Amazon** launched Alexa+ (conversational commerce)
- **Microsoft** launched Copilot Checkout
- **Google** launched UCP + Shopping Agent

AI-mediated interaction is infrastructure now. The CMS industry needs implementation patterns, not just concepts.

**AX told us this was coming. MX provides the response.**

## Opportunities for Collaboration

### CMS Critic Coverage

**Feature article:** "Agent Experience Gets an Implementation Framework"

- How MX makes AX real
- Technical patterns with business implications
- CMS vendor evaluation for MX readiness

**Article series:** Deep dives on specific patterns

- Schema.org for CMS platforms
- Semantic HTML in 2026
- State management for agent-readable interfaces

### Podcast Conversation

**"The Critic's Corner" episode options:**

1. "From AX to MX: Making Agent Experience Real"
2. "The January 2026 Convergence"
3. "CMS Compliance: The Next WCAG?"
4. "Composable Content for Agents"

### MACH Alliance Connection

Given your board involvement, there's potential alignment:

- MACH principles (API-first, headless) create architectural foundation
- MX adds the content layer: structured, typed, explicitly stateful
- Composable architecture + MX = agent-ready enterprise content

---

## What I'd Offer

### For CMS Critic

- Articles on MX implementation
- Vendor analysis for AI readiness
- Interview content for podcast
- Technical deep dives for developer audience

### For You Personally

- Early access to MX-Bible and MX-Handbook
- Collaboration credit on AX/MX connection
- Joint presentation opportunities
- Input on how MX evolves

### For the Industry

- CMS compliance specification
- Audit methodology
- Training materials for vendors and agencies

## Questions You Might Have

**"How is MX different from what Schema.org already does?"**

Schema.org is the vocabulary. MX is the comprehensive approach - Schema.org plus semantic HTML plus explicit state plus metadata patterns, all working together. It's the difference between knowing French words and being able to write French prose.

**"Is this just accessibility by another name?"**

Significant overlap - the convergence principle. But agents have needs humans don't: explicit typing, programmatic state access, structured relationships. Accessibility gets you 60% there; MX completes the picture.

**"How does this fit with MACH?"**

MACH creates the architectural foundation. MX adds the content layer. They're complementary: composable architecture with machine-readable content.

**"What's the adoption path?"**

Start at the template level. Most CMS platforms already support Schema.org injection and semantic HTML. MX compliance is more configuration and best practices than new features.

## The Conversation

When we meet, I'd like to:

1. Explore the AX/MX conceptual alignment
2. Hear your perspective on industry positioning
3. Discuss coverage opportunities
4. Get your input on how MX should evolve

You're shaping how the CMS industry thinks about agents. Your perspective on the implementation framework is valuable.

## Looking Forward

You named the concept. I've built the implementation framework. There's a story here about how ideas evolve into practice.

I appreciate you taking time to consider this.
