## Pre-Meeting Briefing

Prepared for Matt Garrepy

From Tom Cranstoun

Date: January 2026

---

## Purpose of This Document

This briefing introduces **MX (Machine Experience)** - a framework I've been developing that addresses a fundamental problem: digital content is designed for human eyes, but machines can't reliably parse it.

What started as work on AI agent accessibility has evolved into something bigger: a universal layer for all machines to reliably parse and act on digital content. MX is becoming the infrastructure for the machine-readable web.

---

## The Problem: Machines Can't Read the Web

The web is designed for human eyes. Machines visiting these sites can't reliably parse what they encounter.

**The scope extends beyond AI agents to all machines:**

- Autonomous vehicles that can't reliably extract venue addresses for navigation
- Smartwatches that can't parse calendar event details
- Warehouse robots that can't interpret product specifications
- IoT devices that can't understand device compatibility data
- QR code systems that can't access structured product information
- AI agents that can't extract meaning from unstructured content

**Machines are forced to hallucinate connections** - inferring relationships between prices and products, events and venues, addresses and coordinates - because this information isn't explicitly structured.

### The Solution: Machine Experience (MX)

MX creates a shadow web for machines - embedded metadata throughout all digital assets (HTML, PDFs, JPEGs, CSS) that makes content reliably machine-readable:

- Schema.org structured data for explicit typing
- Semantic HTML for parseable structure
- Explicit state attributes for dynamic content
- Machine-readable relationships between entities

**MX eliminates the need for machines to guess.**

### What This Enables

| Without MX | With MX |
|------------|---------|
| Machines infer and hallucinate | Machines read explicit structure |
| Every device independently parses | Universal machine readability |
| Computational inference overhead | Direct data access |
| Unreliable, error-prone | Verifiable, confident |

**MX provides the infrastructure layer all machines need.**

## What I've Developed

### Two Books (Publication-Ready)

**MX-Bible** - Comprehensive guide (78,000+ words, 13 chapters)

- Full explanation of AI agents and web interaction
- Technical patterns and implementation guidance
- Business case and strategic context

**MX-Handbook** - Practical implementation (11 chapters)

- Developer and designer focused
- Step-by-step implementation
- Code examples and patterns

### Supporting Materials

- 12 detailed appendices
- Code examples (good vs bad patterns)
- Web audit tool for MX compliance testing
- CMS compliance specifications

---

## The Three Pillars

MX delivers three interconnected benefits across the entire machine ecosystem:

### 1. Reliability

Without explicit structure, machines hallucinate connections:

- **Problem:** A self-driving car encounters "123 High Street, London" on a restaurant website but can't guarantee navigation coordinates - the relationship between address text and location data isn't explicit.
- **Problem:** A smartwatch parsing a calendar invite sees "Dinner at Giovanni's, 7pm" but can't reliably extract restaurant name, booking time, or contact details - the connections aren't structured.
- **Problem:** A warehouse robot reads product specs but can't confirm the relationship between SKU, dimensions, and weight - forced to infer from proximity in unstructured text.

**MX solution:** Explicit relationships eliminate hallucination. Schema.org typing and semantic markup make connections machine-verifiable. Autonomous systems can act with confidence.

### 2. Efficiency

Machine inference - whether AI language models or robotic vision systems - is computationally expensive.

- **Problem:** Every machine that visits a webpage must independently parse, infer, and validate relationships. This computational overhead compounds across billions of machine interactions.
- **Problem:** IoT devices with limited processing power struggle to extract meaning from unstructured content.

**MX solution:** Structured data removes inference overhead. Machines read explicit relationships rather than computing possibilities. At scale, this matters for both operational cost and energy sustainability.

### 3. Interoperability

The same patterns work across the entire machine ecosystem:

- **Universal standards:** Schema.org vocabulary understood by AI agents, search engines, voice assistants, and IoT devices
- **Cross-device compatibility:** A smartwatch, autonomous vehicle, and warehouse robot can all parse the same MX-compliant content
- **Future-proof:** New machine types can consume existing structured data without custom integration

**MX solution:** One implementation serves all machines. Build once, consumed universally.

## The January 2026 Context

Within seven days:

- **Amazon** launched Alexa+ (conversational commerce)
- **Microsoft** launched Copilot Checkout
- **Google** launched UCP + Shopping Agent

AI-mediated interaction is infrastructure now. The CMS industry needs implementation patterns for machine-readable content.

**MX provides that framework.**

## Opportunities for Collaboration

### CMS Critic Coverage

**Feature article:** "Machine Experience: The Framework for Universal Machine Readability"

- How MX solves the machine-readable content problem
- Technical patterns with business implications
- CMS vendor evaluation for MX readiness

**Article series:** Deep dives on specific patterns

- Schema.org for CMS platforms
- Semantic HTML in 2026
- State management for agent-readable interfaces

### Podcast Conversation

**"The Critic's Corner" episode options:**

1. "Machine Experience: The Infrastructure Layer We're Missing"
2. "The January 2026 Convergence"
3. "CMS Compliance: The Next WCAG?"
4. "Composable Content for Machines"

### MACH Alliance Connection

Given your board involvement, there's potential alignment:

- MACH principles (API-first, headless) create architectural foundation
- MX adds the content layer: structured, typed, explicitly stateful
- Composable architecture + MX = agent-ready enterprise content

---

## What I'd Offer

### For CMS Critic

- Articles on MX implementation
- Vendor analysis for AI readiness
- Interview content for podcast
- Technical deep dives for developer audience

### For You Personally

- Early access to MX-Bible and MX-Handbook
- Joint presentation opportunities on machine-readable web
- Input on how MX evolves
- Industry perspective sharing

### For the Industry

- CMS compliance specification
- Audit methodology
- Training materials for vendors and agencies

**A note on scope:** This document focuses on the CMS and content angle - your audience. But the vision is significantly broader: a shadow web for all machines, with machine-readable metadata embedded in every digital asset. Let's start with what we can implement today and see where it leads.

---

## Questions You Might Have

### "How is MX different from what Schema.org already does?"

Schema.org is the vocabulary. MX is the comprehensive approach - Schema.org plus semantic HTML plus explicit state plus metadata patterns, all working together. It's the difference between knowing French words and being able to write French prose.

### "Is this just accessibility by another name?"

Significant overlap - the convergence principle. But machines have needs humans don't: explicit typing, programmatic state access, structured relationships, verifiable connections between entities. Accessibility gets you 60% there; MX completes the picture for the full machine ecosystem.

### "How does this fit with MACH?"

MACH creates the architectural foundation. MX adds the content layer. They're complementary: composable architecture with machine-readable content.

### "What's the adoption path?"

Start at the template level. Most CMS platforms already support Schema.org injection and semantic HTML. MX compliance is more configuration and best practices than new features.

## The Conversation

When we meet, I'd like to:

1. Explore the machine-readable web imperative for CMS
2. Hear your perspective on industry positioning
3. Discuss coverage opportunities
4. Get your input on how MX should evolve

You're shaping how the CMS industry thinks about agents. Your perspective on the implementation framework is valuable.

## Looking Forward

The web is evolving from human-only to human + machine. MX provides the infrastructure layer that makes this transition reliable, efficient, and universal.

I believe this conversation fits naturally with your CMS Critic coverage - you're documenting how content systems adapt to emerging use cases. The machine-readable web is one of those adaptations.

I appreciate you taking time to consider this.
