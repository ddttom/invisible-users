# Matt Garrepy - Outreach Folder

Professional outreach for Matt Garrepy, connecting MX with his "Agent Experience" concept.

## Key Insight

**Matt coined "Agent Experience" (AX). MX is the implementation framework for AX.**

- AX = the concept (agents as designed-for users)
- MX = the patterns (Schema.org, semantic HTML, explicit state)

This is conceptual alignment, not a sales pitch.
