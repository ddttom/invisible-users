# Matt Garrepy - MX Collaboration

**Professional friend, fellow CMS thinker, and the person who coined "Agent Experience."**

---

## Why This Conversation Matters

Matt Garrepy coined **"Agent Experience" (AX)** - the concept that AI agents interacting with digital experiences deserve the same design consideration as human users.

MX (Machine Experience) is the implementation framework for that vision.

**AX is the "why." MX is the "how."**

This isn't a sales pitch. This is connecting two complementary ideas that should be in conversation.

## Matt's Profile

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Role** | Chief Critic, CMS Critic |
| **Day Job** | Chief Digital Officer, Solodev |
| **Location** | Orlando, Florida |
| **Coined Terms** | "Agent Experience" (AX), "Jamstack" |
| **Podcast** | "The Critic's Corner" |
| **Board Seats** | MACH Alliance, Full Sail, AWS Marketplace, Special Olympics USA Games |
| **Background** | Silicon Valley veteran, IBM/Microsoft/Verizon experience |

### Why He Matters

1. **Concept influencer** - He doesn't just report on trends, he names them. "Jamstack" shaped how we talk about static site architecture. "Agent Experience" is doing the same for AI-CMS interaction.

2. **MACH Alliance board** - Direct influence on composable architecture standards and vendor direction.

3. **CMS Critic platform** - The most trusted CMS publication, reaching vendors, agencies, and enterprise buyers.

4. **Podcast host** - Direct channel to CMS decision-makers and practitioners.

5. **Already thinking about this** - AX shows he's already grappling with the questions MX answers.

## The MX + AX Connection

### Agent Experience (AX) - Matt's Concept

The idea that AI agents are becoming a primary audience for digital experiences, and we need to design for them deliberately.

> "Agent Experience" became the undercurrent of "The Composable Conference" - the MACH Alliance's signature event.

### Machine Experience (MX) - The Implementation

The patterns and standards that make AX achievable:

- Schema.org structured data for content typing
- Semantic HTML for parseable structure
- Explicit state attributes for dynamic content
- MX metadata for AI discoverability

**AX asks:** "How should we think about agents as users?"
**MX answers:** "Here's how to build for them."

### The Synthesis

| AX (Concept) | MX (Implementation) |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Agents need designed experiences | Here are the design patterns |
| Content should be agent-readable | Schema.org + semantic HTML |
| State should be explicit | data-* attributes + ARIA |
| Discovery should work | MX metadata + llms.txt |

Matt identified the need. MX provides the toolkit.

## Existing Relationship

**Tom writes for CMS Critic.**

This isn't cold outreach. There's an established professional relationship and mutual respect for each other's thinking about CMS and digital experience.

## Conversation Angles

### Angle 1: Conceptual Alignment

> "Matt, I've been developing something that I think completes the Agent Experience picture. You've articulated the 'why' brilliantly - agents as first-class users. I've been working on the 'how' - the implementation patterns that make AX achievable. I'm calling it Machine Experience, or MX. I'd love to explore how these concepts connect."

### Angle 2: CMS Critic Coverage

> "I think there's a story here for CMS Critic: the emergence of implementation standards for agent-friendly content. Schema.org adoption, semantic HTML requirements, the metadata patterns that make CMS content AI-parseable. This fits the January 2026 convergence narrative perfectly - Amazon, Microsoft, Google all launching agent commerce within a week."

### Angle 3: Podcast Conversation

> "Would 'The Critic's Corner' be interested in exploring the implementation side of Agent Experience? I could talk through the MX framework - what it takes to make CMS content genuinely agent-readable, the patterns that work, the anti-patterns to avoid. It's the practical follow-through on the AX vision."

### Angle 4: MACH Alliance Connection

> "Given your MACH Alliance involvement, I'm curious how MX patterns fit with composable thinking. The modular, API-first approach of MACH seems naturally aligned with explicit, structured content that agents can consume. Is there an angle here for the Alliance to consider?"

### Angle 5: Vendor Influence

> "You're uniquely positioned to influence how CMS vendors think about agent readiness. If MX compliance became a evaluation criterion - like WCAG compliance or headless API support - it would accelerate adoption across the market. What would it take to make that happen?"

## Questions Matt Might Have

### "How is MX different from what Schema.org already does?"

> "Schema.org is the vocabulary. MX is the comprehensive approach - Schema.org plus semantic HTML plus explicit state plus metadata patterns, all working together. It's the difference between knowing French words and being able to write French prose."

### "Is this just accessibility by another name?"

> "There's significant overlap - the convergence principle. But agents have needs humans don't: they need explicit typing, programmatic state access, and structured relationships. Accessibility gets you 60% there; MX completes the picture."

### "Why should CMS vendors care?"

> "Because agent-mediated discovery is becoming a primary channel. When someone asks Claude 'recommend a headless CMS,' the CMS with machine-readable documentation and structured content gets recommended. The others don't exist in that conversation."

### "What's the adoption path?"

> "Start at the template level. Most CMS platforms already support Schema.org injection and semantic HTML. MX compliance is more about configuration and best practices than new features. The infrastructure exists; the patterns need documenting."

### "How does this fit with MACH?"

> "MACH principles - Microservices, API-first, Cloud-native, Headless - create the architectural foundation. MX adds the content layer: structured, typed, explicitly stateful content that agents can consume via those APIs. They're complementary, not competing."

---

## Conversation Flow

### Opening

Start with genuine connection - you write for his publication, you respect his thinking on AX.

> "Matt, I wanted to talk to you about something that I think builds on Agent Experience. I've been developing implementation patterns for making the AX vision real, and I'd value your perspective."

### The Pitch (60 seconds)

> "You coined AX - the idea that agents deserve designed experiences. I've been working on MX, Machine Experience - the implementation framework. Schema.org for content typing, semantic HTML for structure, explicit state for dynamics. It's the toolkit that makes AX achievable.
>
> The timing feels right. January 2026 had Amazon, Microsoft, and Google all launching agent commerce within seven days. This is becoming infrastructure, not experiment."

### The Ask

Be clear about what you're hoping for:

> "I'd love your take on the conceptual alignment. And if it resonates, I think there's CMS Critic coverage here - maybe an article, maybe a podcast conversation. But first, I want to know if the MX framework makes sense to you."

### Listen

His perspective on AX implementation is valuable. He may have insights that shape how MX evolves.
