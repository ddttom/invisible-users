# Lars Trieloff - Outreach Folder

Technical outreach for Lars Trieloff, connecting MX with Edge Delivery Services.

## Key Insight

**Edge Delivery Services + MX = AI-discoverable performance.**

EDS optimises for speed. MX optimises for discoverability. The edge is the ideal place to generate/inject MX compliance - no origin overhead, consistent application, cacheable structured data.

| [outreach.md](outreach.md) ("Lars Trieloff - MX + Edge Delivery Services" at <https://github.com/ddttom/invisible-users/blob/main/docs/structure/prospects/lars-trieloff/outreach.md>) | Full technical outreach with architecture ideas, conversation angles, deep dive topics, Q&A preparation |

## Technical Opportunity

```
Content authored in AEM
         ↓
Edge functions process content
         ↓
MX metadata generated/injected at edge
         ↓
Response includes Schema.org + semantic HTML
         ↓
Fast delivery + AI parseable
```

## Integration Points

1. **Schema.org generation** at edge functions
2. **Semantic HTML transformation** in EDS pipeline
3. **MX meta tag injection** at response level
4. **State exposure** for dynamic components

## Approach

- Lead with technical architecture discussion
- Focus on edge as the natural MX layer
- Ask questions - his enterprise experience will surface considerations
- Position as complementary to EDS performance focus
- No sales pitch - peer technical conversation
