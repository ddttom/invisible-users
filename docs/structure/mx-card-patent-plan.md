# MX-Card System - Patent Application Plan

**Status:** PLAN - CONFIDENTIAL
**Date:** 26 January 2026

---

## Overview

This plan outlines the strategy for securing patent protection for the MX-Card System, including filing approach, jurisdiction selection, and claim development.

---

## Patent Filing Strategy

### Recommended Approach: Provisional Patent First

**Why Provisional?**
- Establishes priority date immediately
- Lower cost (approximately £200-500 vs £5,000+ for full application)
- Provides 12 months to develop full specification
- Allows "Patent Pending" status
- Time to assess commercial viability

### Filing Jurisdictions

| Priority | Jurisdiction | Rationale | Estimated Cost |
|----------|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | **UK (UKIPO)** | Home jurisdiction, lower cost | £230 provisional |
| 2 | **USPTO (US)** | Largest AI/tech market | $320 provisional |
| 3 | **EPO (Europe)** | Single filing for 38 countries | €1,500+ |
| 4 | **PCT (International)** | Preserves rights in 150+ countries | £3,000+ |

**Recommendation:** File UK provisional immediately, then US provisional within 30 days. Consider PCT within 12 months.

## Patent Claims Structure

### Primary Claims (Utility Patent)

Based on the patent disclosure document, file claims for:

#### Claim Group 1: MX-Card System (Core)
- Standardised machine-readable data containers

- Owner contact routines

#### Claim Group 2: Registry System
- Domain-verified ownership
- DNS/repository token verification
- Tiered access (business/open-source)
- Data sovereignty routing

#### Claim Group 3: Identity Layer
- Personal preference containers
- Inheritance model (preferences → card responses)
- Selective sharing with privacy controls
- Cross-card data propagation

#### Claim Group 4: Anti-Hallucination Method
- Verified context provision at physical locations
- Token expenditure reduction methodology
- Direct context injection for AI agents
- Universal physical object application

### Design Patents (Optional)
Consider design patents for:
- MX-Card visual schema/format
- QR code framing/branding
- App interface elements

## Filing Timeline

### Phase 1: Provisional Filing (Immediate)

| Task | Target Date | Owner | Status |
|------|-------------|-------|--------|
| Finalise patent disclosure document | Week 1 | Tom | In Progress |
| Engage patent attorney (initial consultation) | Week 1-2 | Tom | Pending |
| Prepare provisional specification | Week 2-3 | Attorney | Pending |
| File UK provisional | Week 3-4 | Attorney | Pending |
| File US provisional | Week 4-5 | Attorney | Pending |

### Phase 2: Development Period (Months 2-10)

| Task | Target | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Develop working prototype | Month 3-6 | Strengthens patent |
| Document implementation details | Ongoing | Adds to specification |
| Conduct prior art search | Month 2-3 | Professional search |
| Refine claims based on search | Month 4 | Attorney review |
| Consider additional claims | Month 6 | New innovations |

### Phase 3: Full Patent Filing (Month 10-12)

| Task | Target | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Prepare full specification | Month 10 | Based on provisional + development |
| File full UK patent | Month 11 | Convert provisional |
| File full US patent | Month 11 | Convert provisional |
| Consider PCT filing | Month 12 | International protection |

## Prior Art Search Strategy

### DIY Initial Search (Complete Before Attorney)

**Databases to Search:**
- Google Patents (patents.google.com)
- USPTO Patent Full-Text Database
- Espacenet (European patents)
- WIPO PatentScope

**Search Terms:**
- "machine readable context" + "QR code"
- "AI agent" + "physical object" + "context"
- "identity layer" + "preference" + "inheritance"
- "anti-hallucination" + "verified context"
- "domain verification" + "ownership" + "registry"

**Known Prior Art to Distinguish:**
| Technology | How MX-Cards Differ |
|------------|---------------------|
| QR Codes (Denso Wave, 1994) | QR is transport only; MX-Card is structured content + registry |
| vCard (RFC 6350) | Contact data only; no instructions, no verification |
| Schema.org | No registry, no access control, no identity layer |
| NFC Tags | Similar transport; MX-Card adds structure + verification |
| Digital Business Cards | Human-focused; MX-Cards are machine-focused |

### Professional Prior Art Search

**Recommended:** Commission professional search from patent attorney or specialised firm

**Estimated Cost:** £500-2,000
**Value:** Identifies blocking patents, strengthens claims, reduces rejection risk

## Risk Assessment

### Risks to Patent Grant

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|------------|------------|
| Prior art discovered | Medium | Thorough search, narrow claims |
| Obviousness rejection | Medium | Emphasise technical effect, anti-hallucination |
| Abstract idea rejection (US) | Medium | Focus on technical implementation |
| Insufficient disclosure | Low | Detailed specification with examples |

### Strategic Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|------------|------------|
| Competitor files first | Low | File provisional immediately |
| Patent too narrow | Medium | Multiple claim groups, continuation |
| Enforcement cost | High | Focus on licensing vs. litigation |
| Technology evolves | Medium | Broad initial claims, continuations |

---

## Maintenance and Renewal

### Post-Grant Requirements
