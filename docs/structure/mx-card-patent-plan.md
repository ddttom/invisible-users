# MX-Card System - Patent Application Plan

**Status:** PLAN - CONFIDENTIAL
**Date:** 26 January 2026

---

## Overview

This plan outlines the strategy for securing patent protection for the MX-Card System, including filing approach, jurisdiction selection, and claim development.

---

## Patent Filing Strategy

### Recommended Approach: Provisional Patent First

**Why Provisional?**
- Establishes priority date immediately
- Lower cost (approximately £200-500 vs £5,000+ for full application)
- Provides 12 months to develop full specification
- Allows "Patent Pending" status
- Time to assess commercial viability

### Filing Jurisdictions

| Priority | Jurisdiction | Rationale | Estimated Cost |
|----------|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | **UK (UKIPO)** | Home jurisdiction, lower cost | £230 provisional |
| 2 | **USPTO (US)** | Largest AI/tech market | $320 provisional |
| 3 | **EPO (Europe)** | Single filing for 38 countries | €1,500+ |
| 4 | **PCT (International)** | Preserves rights in 150+ countries | £3,000+ |

**Recommendation:** File UK provisional immediately, then US provisional within 30 days. Consider PCT within 12 months.

- Selective sharing with privacy controls
- Cross-card data propagation

#### Claim Group 4: Anti-Hallucination Method
- Verified context provision at physical locations
- Token expenditure reduction methodology
- Direct context injection for AI agents
- Universal physical object application

### Design Patents (Optional)

|------|-------------|-------|--------|
| Finalise patent disclosure document | Week 1 | Tom | In Progress |
| Engage patent attorney (initial consultation) | Week 1-2 | Tom | Pending |
| Prepare provisional specification | Week 2-3 | Attorney | Pending |
| File UK provisional | Week 3-4 | Attorney | Pending |
| File US provisional | Week 4-5 | Attorney | Pending |

---

## Prior Art Search Strategy

### DIY Initial Search (Complete Before Attorney)

**Databases to Search:**
- Google Patents (patents.google.com)
- USPTO Patent Full-Text Database
- Espacenet (European patents)
- WIPO PatentScope

**Search Terms:**
- "machine readable context" + "QR code"
- "AI agent" + "physical object" + "context"
- "identity layer" + "preference" + "inheritance"
- "anti-hallucination" + "verified context"
- "domain verification" + "ownership" + "registry"

**Known Prior Art to Distinguish:**
| Technology | How MX-Cards Differ |
|------------|---------------------|
| QR Codes (Denso Wave, 1994) | QR is transport only; MX-Card is structured content + registry |
| vCard (RFC 6350) | Contact data only; no instructions, no verification |
| Schema.org | No registry, no access control, no identity layer |
| NFC Tags | Similar transport; MX-Card adds structure + verification |
| Digital Business Cards | Human-focused; MX-Cards are machine-focused |

### Professional Prior Art Search

**Recommended:** Commission professional search from patent attorney or specialised firm

**Estimated Cost:** £500-2,000
**Value:** Identifies blocking patents, strengthens claims, reduces rejection risk

## Patent Attorney Selection

### Criteria for Selection

- Experience with software/method patents
- Understanding of AI/ML technology
- UK and US filing capability (or partnership with US firm)
- Reasonable hourly rates (£200-400/hour typical)
- Clear communication style
- Fixed-fee options for provisional filing

### Recommended Approach

1. **Initial consultation** with 2-3 attorneys (many offer free 30-min calls)
2. **Share patent disclosure document** for feedback on patentability
3. **Request fixed-fee quote** for provisional filing
4. **Ask about rejection rates** and examination success
5. **Check references** from other tech/AI clients

### UK Patent Attorney Firms (Software/AI Specialists)

Research these firms for initial consultations:

| Firm Type | Examples | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Boutique IP Firms** | Mathys & Squire, Mewburn Ellis, Marks & Clerk | Strong software/AI practice |
| **Tech-Focused** | Reddie & Grose, Carpmaels & Ransford | Cambridge/London tech corridor |
| **Startup-Friendly** | Dehns, Appleyard Lees | Often offer fixed fees, startup discounts |
| **Solo Practitioners** | CIPA directory search | Lower overhead, potentially lower cost |

### Finding the Right Attorney

**CIPA Directory Search:**
1. Visit: cipa.org.uk/find-an-attorney
2. Filter by: Technology area → "Computing & IT" or "Electronics"
3. Filter by: Location → Your region
4. Look for: "AI", "software", "method patents" in profiles

**Questions to Ask in Consultation:**
- "What's your experience with software method patents?"
- "Have you filed AI-related patents before?"
- "What's your typical allowance rate for software patents?"
- "Can you provide a fixed fee for provisional filing?"
- "Do you have US filing capability or a US partner firm?"

### Cost-Saving Strategies

1. **DIY Provisional + Attorney Full:** File provisional yourself (£60), then engage attorney for full application
2. **Fixed-Fee Packages:** Many firms offer fixed fees for provisional (£1,500-2,500)
3. **Startup Discounts:** Some firms offer 20-30% discount for startups
4. **Academic Rates:** If affiliated with university, may qualify for reduced rates
5. **Deferred Payment:** Some attorneys offer payment plans tied to grant

## Risk Assessment

### Risks to Patent Grant

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|------------|------------|
| Prior art discovered | Medium | Thorough search, narrow claims |
| Obviousness rejection | Medium | Emphasise technical effect, anti-hallucination |
| Abstract idea rejection (US) | Medium | Focus on technical implementation |
| Insufficient disclosure | Low | Detailed specification with examples |

### Strategic Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|------------|------------|
| Competitor files first | Low | File provisional immediately |
| Patent too narrow | Medium | Multiple claim groups, continuation |
| Enforcement cost | High | Focus on licensing vs. litigation |
| Technology evolves | Medium | Broad initial claims, continuations |

## Maintenance and Renewal

### Post-Grant Requirements

**UK Patent:**
- Renewal fees from year 5: £70-600/year (increasing)
- 20-year maximum term

**US Patent:**
- Maintenance fees at 3.5, 7.5, 11.5 years: $1,600-7,400
- 20-year maximum term from filing
