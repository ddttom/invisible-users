## Usage Notes

### Before Using This NDA

1. **Consider timing:** Filing a UK provisional patent application first provides stronger protection than an NDA alone

2. **Assess the recipient:** For trusted colleagues, this NDA may be sufficient. For potential competitors or investors, seek legal advice

3. **Document everything:** Keep records of what was discussed, when, and with whom

### Practical Tips

- **Email confirmation:** After verbal discussions, send an email summarising what was shared, referencing the NDA

- **Limit disclosure:** Only share what's necessary for the specific purpose

- **Staged disclosure:** Share general concepts first, technical details only if collaboration proceeds

- **Time-stamp evidence:** Keep dated notes of all disclosures

### When an NDA May Not Be Sufficient

- Discussions with large corporations (they often refuse to sign NDAs)
- Public presentations or conferences
- Discussions where you cannot verify the recipient's identity
- Situations where enforcement would be impractical

In these cases, file your provisional patent application first, then discuss freely.
