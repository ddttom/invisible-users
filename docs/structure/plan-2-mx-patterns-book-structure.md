# Plan 2: Structure for MX: The Patterns of Machine Experience

## Executive Summary

This plan defines the complete structure for "MX: The Patterns of Machine Experience", a new book that consolidates pattern-focused content from the MX-Gathering Futures folder into a comprehensive pattern language for human-machine collaboration. The book adopts a hybrid approach: foundational chapters establish core concepts, whilst proposal chapters invite community discussion and refinement.

## Book Overview

### Title and Positioning

**Title:** MX: The Patterns of Machine Experience

**Subtitle:** A Collaborative Framework for Human-Machine Co-Creation

**Format:** Pattern language book combining established knowledge (Christopher Alexander style) with modern software patterns (Gang of Four, ADRs) adapted for agent systems

**Relationship to MX-Bible:**
- MX-Bible addresses the "what" and "why" of agent-friendly design
- MX Patterns addresses the "how" through structured, reusable patterns
- Cross-references between books create comprehensive coverage

### Target Audience

**Primary Audience:**
- MX practitioners building pattern libraries
- Software architects designing agent systems
- Tool builders creating pattern editors and validators
- Governance professionals establishing standards

**Secondary Audience:**
- Community members contributing to pattern evolution
- Academic researchers studying human-machine collaboration
- Platform architects designing for dual audiences
- Open-source maintainers adopting pattern-based documentation

### Book Characteristics

**Format Decisions:**
- **Part I (Chapters 1-4):** Definitive chapters (established knowledge)
- **Parts II-IV (Chapters 5-12):** Proposal chapters (community discussion)
- **Part V (Appendices):** Reference materials (practical tools)

**Writing Style:**
- British English throughout (organise, colour, whilst)
- First-person narrative voice (matching MX-Bible)
- Professional tone without superlatives
- Balance philosophical depth with practical guidance
- Include real examples throughout
- Add "Open Questions" sections in proposal chapters
- Use timeless present tense (avoid future-tense statements about the book)
