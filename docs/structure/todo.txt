The blog post is ready tor publication!

The message "your browser does not support svg" is weird, especially as it offers to open the svg. this wil not work for Al or for Humans. fix this in the skiil, just display the mesasage and the alt text

machine-experience-adding-metadata.html

• Thinking v

• You're absolutely right! The fallback is confusing and won't work well for either Al agents or humans. Let me fix the skill documentation to use a simpler, clearer fallback.
Original problem: "Your browser does not support SVG" was confusing and didn't work for AI agents
First fix attempt: Added descriptive text inside <object> - but this duplicated the figcaption
Final solution: Empty fallback - figcaption already provides all necessary context without redundancy
Trade-off: If an SVG fails to load, there's no inline warning message. However, the figcaption still tells users wha

Alt text on svg

What It Means
Text appears to be a table caption, but is not a caption element.
Why It Matters
A table caption should be associated with a table using the <caption> element so it will be read by a screen reader with the table content.
What To Do
If the text is a description of the table, associate the text with the table using the <caption> element (<caption> should be the first element within the <table>).
The Algorithm... in English
A data table (has at least one table header) that does not already have a caption has: - A colspan attribute value of 3 or greater on the first cell of the table. - A <p> element immediately before the table that contains less than 50 characters or contains less than 100 characters and is bold and/or centered.

Pitch


Your website has invisible users right now—AI agents visiting on behalf of humans, comparing products, checking pricing, attempting purchases. Adobe's Holiday 2025 data reveals the transformation: AI referrals up 700% in retail, 500% in travel, with conversion rates now leading human traffic by 30%.

The problem? Five different types of agents, each with different technical constraints:

Server-side agents (ChatGPT, Claude) - Can't see JavaScript or CSS, need semantic HTML
In-browser agents (Copilot, extensions) - See rendered pages, need explicit state in DOM
Browser automation (Perplexity, Playwright) - Full browser control plus screenshots
Local agents (Ollama, on-device) - Limited context windows, need concise structure
Agentic OS (Cowork) - Orchestrate multiple agents, need consistent patterns across all
When these agents must "think"—infer meaning from incomplete context—they hallucinate. That £2,030 Danube cruise becomes £203,000. Lawyers cite fictional Ally McBeal episodes as legal precedent. Modern CMS platforms create divs without semantic meaning, serve plain HTML that JavaScript decorates later. Agents see one version, browsers see another.

Machine Experience (MX) is the practice of adding metadata and instructions so AI agents don't have to think. The 5-stage agent journey shows exactly where sites fail:

Discovery - Without semantic structure, you're not in their training data
Citation - Without Schema.org, agents can't confidently recommend you
Search & Compare - Without JSON-LD, agents can't extract product features
Price Understanding - Without proper currency markup, agents misread pricing by 100x
Purchase Confidence - Without a persistent state, agents abandon checkout
Miss any stage and the entire commerce chain breaks. Toast notifications vanish before agents read them. JavaScript-only state (let currentStep = 1) means agents can't track progress. Hidden fees prevent accurate price comparison.

Here's the convergence principle: what machines need equals what disabled users have needed for years. Semantic HTML helps server-side agents AND screen readers. Explicit state attributes (data-state="active") help browser agents AND keyboard users. Schema.org structured data helps price comparison agents AND voice assistants for blind users. One implementation serves multiple audiences, but the business case—agent commerce, conversions, revenue—drives the requirements.

MX requires dedicated roles—just like QA engineering. When "everyone's responsible," accountability vanishes (diffusion of responsibility research confirms this). Successful organizations need MX specialists who define agent-readability standards, audit implementations, prevent agent failures before deployment. Can expand existing accessibility roles since technical patterns overlap substantially.

January 2026 marked the inflection point: Amazon Alexa+, Microsoft Copilot Checkout, and Google Universal Commerce Protocol all launched within seven days. What analysts predicted would take 12-24 months is now expected in 6-9 months or less. Sites that work early gain "computational trust"—agents preferentially recommend proven-successful sources through learned behavior. Sites that fail disappear from recommendations with no analytics visibility and no recovery opportunity. Within two years, machines will read websites, not humans. This isn't distant future—it's today.
