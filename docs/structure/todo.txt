## Active Tasks

### Blog Workflow Documentation

- [x] Add blog workflow and metadata system to MX-Bible book ✅ COMPLETED 26/Jan/2026
  - Location: Appendix P (Blog Generation Workflow)
  - Content: Complete documentation added covering:
    - Metadata schema (YAML frontmatter for markdown, meta tags for HTML)
    - State tracking system (draft, in-review, published, archived)
    - File organization (docs/structure/blog-drafts/ for drafts, outputs/bible/blogs/mx/ for review/published)
    - Generation workflow using scripts/generate-blog-html.js
    - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance requirements
    - State transition rules
  - Cross-reference added to Chapter 12 (Technical Advice)
  - Files modified:
    - packages/shared-appendices/appendix-p-blog-generation-workflow.md (new file, ~5,800 words)
    - packages/bible/chapters/chapter-12-technical-advice.md (cross-reference added)
  - Reference: [docs/structure/blog-metadata-schema.md](blog-metadata-schema.md) (complete schema definition)
  - Reference: [config/system/doc-architecture.md](../../config/system/doc-architecture.md#blog-content-workflow) (workflow documentation)
  - Rationale: Blog generation demonstrates MX principles in practice (metadata-driven, AI-friendly HTML, semantic structure)

- [ ] Create MX-compatible publishing workflow
  - Purpose: Define the workflow from final committee review to live publication on allabout.network
  - Current state: All HTML files in outputs/bible/blogs/mx/ are in "final-committee-review" status
  - Required steps:
    - Committee review process and sign-off criteria
    - Pre-publication validation checklist (HTML validation, WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, metadata completeness)
    - Deployment process to allabout.network (hosting platform, deployment method, URL structure)
    - Post-publication state updates (update blog-state to "published", add publication-date, add blog-url to markdown)
    - Archival workflow (when to archive, how to mark archived content)
  - MX compatibility requirements:
    - Preserve all metadata during deployment
    - Maintain canonical URLs in meta tags
    - Ensure robots.txt and llms.txt are properly configured
    - Verify Schema.org JSON-LD remains intact
    - Test AI agent accessibility post-deployment
  - Documentation location: Create docs/workflows/blog-publishing.md
  - Integration: Link from blog-metadata-schema.md and doc-architecture.md
  - Reference: See blog-review-status meta tag in all HTML files (currently "final-committee-review")

### Blog Post Issues

- [ ] Review SVG fallback pattern in blog generation workflow
  - Current issue: "Your browser does not support SVG" message is confusing for AI agents and humans
  - Location: `.claude/skills/create-blog/skill.md`
  - Resolution: Empty fallback (figcaption provides all necessary context)

- [ ] Review published blog post: machine-experience-adding-metadata.html
  - Status: Ready for publication
  - Screenshot reference: `/Users/tomcranstoun/Desktop/Dumps2/CleanShot 2026-01-22 at 18.03.12@2x.png`

- [ ] Claude skills static snapshot blog post
  - Draft location: [docs/structure/blog-drafts/claude-skills-static-not-subroutines.md](blog-drafts/claude-skills-static-not-subroutines.md)
  - Status: Draft created 26/Jan/2026
  - Key concept: Skills are static snapshots locked into time at creation, not dynamic subroutines
  - **Summary:** Claude Code skills are NOT subroutines that execute dynamically. When a skill is created, it reads the authoritative source (e.g., a template file, documentation), extracts patterns, and hard-codes instructions into the skill.md file. If the authoritative source changes later, the skill does NOT understand those changes - it remains locked into the state from creation time. Skills must be manually regenerated to incorporate updated source material. Common misconception: developers expect skills to re-read sources on each invocation (they don't). This is an architectural constraint, not a bug.
  - Questions to resolve:
    - Should this concept be added to MX-Bible book?
    - Where in the book? (Chapter 12 Technical Advice? New appendix on AI tooling?)
    - Should we create a paragraph or two documenting this architectural principle?
    - Does this relate to the broader MX pattern of "documentation as static snapshot vs dynamic reference"?
  - Next steps: Review for technical accuracy, decide on book integration

### Accessibility Items for Review

- [ ] Table caption accessibility
  - Issue: Text appearing as table description but not using `<caption>` element
  - Action: Review table structures across generated HTML files
  - Reference: Wave accessibility checker finding

- [ ] Contrast ratio compliance
  - Issue: Some colour combinations may not meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
  - Action: Audit blog post colour schemes with contrast checker

## Recent Work (Archive Reference)

### Completed: Move profiles folder (25/Jan/2026)

**Action:** Moved profiles folder from sales-enablement to mx-gathering

**Files Moved:**
- claude.code.md
- tom.cranstoun.md
- unknown.md

**References Updated:**
- `.claude/skills/create-blog/skill.md` - Updated profile file path references
- `packages/sales-enablement/CLAUDE.md` - Removed profiles from directory structure
- `packages/sales-enablement/README.md` - Removed profiles section
- `packages/mx-gathering/README.md` - Added profiles section

**Commits:** All pushed following submodule-first workflow (see CHANGELOG.md for details)

### Completed: Appendix K Enhancement (26/Jan/2026)

**Action:** Added three comprehensive reference sections to Appendix K (Common Page Patterns)

**Sections Added:**
- K.3: JSON-LD Schema.org Templates - Quick reference templates for 9 core Schema.org types
- K.4: Call-to-Action (CTA) Patterns - 8 production-ready CTA implementations with accessibility
- K.5: Resource Lists & Machine-Parsable Structures - 7 list patterns with Schema.org markup

**Metrics:**
- Lines added: ~1,654 (from 3,378 to 5,032 lines)
- Words added: ~4,561 (from 12,517 to 17,078 words)
- Validation: All markdown linting passed (fixed MD024, MD032 warnings)

**File Modified:**
- packages/shared-appendices/appendix-k-common-page-patterns.md

**Rationale:** Strategic plan identified Appendix K as Priority 2 ("the practical heart of the book"). These reference sections provide quick-reference templates that practitioners will use daily for implementing AI-friendly patterns.

### Completed: Core Manuscript Finalization (26/Jan/2026) ✅

**Action:** Strategic Plan Section 1.2 - Finalise the Core Manuscript

**All Four Actions Completed:**
1. ✅ Terminology consistency audit (technical terms "bot", "scraper" verified as legitimate in server logs/configuration contexts)
2. ✅ Cross-references added: 7 new cross-references to appendices
   - Chapter 4 → Appendix H (llms.txt implementation)
   - Chapter 11 → Appendix H (llms.txt) + Appendix F (implementation roadmap)
   - Chapter 12 → Appendix H (llms.txt) + Appendix C (Web Audit Suite)
   - Chapter 15 → Appendix N (anti-patterns catalog) + Appendix C (Web Audit Suite)
3. ✅ Metadata examples verified as appropriately distributed (chapters 10-12 have technical examples per writing style guide)
4. ✅ Diagrams added: 9 total illustration references added
   - Chapter 1: Same website different reality (what humans see vs agents parse)
   - Chapter 11: Convergence principle (one pattern helps everyone)
   - Chapter 15: Seven IA diagrams (three-layer framework, heading hierarchy, training-inference paths, URL structure comparison, navigation hierarchy, antipattern flat structure, sitemap as TOC)

**Files Modified:**
- packages/bible/chapters/chapter-01-what-you-will-learn.md (1 diagram reference)
- packages/bible/chapters/chapter-04-the-business-reality.md (1 cross-reference)
- packages/bible/chapters/chapter-11-designing-for-both.md (2 cross-references + 1 diagram reference)
- packages/bible/chapters/chapter-12-technical-advice.md (2 cross-references)
- packages/bible/chapters/chapter-15-information-architecture-llm-web.md (2 cross-references + 7 diagram references)

**Rationale:** Strategic Plan Section 1.2 identified four core actions to finalise the manuscript. All completed systematically with appropriate balance between technical depth and business focus per writing style guide.
