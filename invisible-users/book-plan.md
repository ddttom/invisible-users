## Thesis

The patterns that break AI agents also break humans. Toast notifications that vanish, pagination hiding content, single-page applications with invisible state changes — these have been creating accessibility problems for years. Now AI agents are struggling with the same patterns, and there's commercial pressure to fix them.

This book explores the technical, business, ethical, and human implications of this collision, and provides practical solutions that work for both humans and machines.

**Key insight:** Pipeline failures occur when agents fail to validate data during extraction. The £203,000 cruise pricing error wouldn't have occurred if either the website provided clear structured data (Chapter 11) or the agent had validation layers (Chapter 12). Both sides must improve.

**Enhanced with:** Complete validation pipeline code examples showing range checking, comparative analysis, incomplete data detection, confidence scoring, and graceful degradation patterns

## Key Concepts

### The Convergence Principle

What AI agents need is mostly what everyone needs. Solutions that work for agents typically improve experiences for users with accessibility needs, people with ADHD, stressed parents, and others.

### Session Inheritance Problem

Key security insight (Chapter 6): In-browser agents inherit authenticated sessions rather than failing to authenticate. Banks cannot detect AI involvement because agents inherit proof-of-humanity tokens from the authenticated user's session.

### Identity Delegation

When agents make purchases, businesses lose customer identity. Mentioned briefly as one emerging solution pattern. Multiple approaches acknowledged (retailer-specific tokens, centralised repositories, blockchain attestations, browser-native delegation). Detailed technical specification moved to separate identity-layer repository.
