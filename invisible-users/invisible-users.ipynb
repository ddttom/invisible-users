   "source": "# The Invisible Users\n\n## Designing the Web for AI Agents and Everyone Else\n\nWelcome to an interactive exploration of how modern web design fails for AI agents—and why fixing it benefits everyone.\n\n---\n\n**About this notebook:** This is an interactive companion to the book \"The Invisible Users\" by Tom Cranstoun. It presents key concepts through demonstrations and explorations, encouraging you to dive deeper into the full manuscript.\n\n**What this book is:** A theory book offering frameworks for thinking about an emerging problem—not a research study with validated findings. The field of AI agent interaction with websites is too new for comprehensive empirical research. Figures and examples are illustrative, not statistically validated. Read the [Executive Summary](invisible-users/executive-summary.md) for a concise business-focused briefing.\n\n**Time to complete:** 60-75 minutes\n\n**What you'll learn:**\n- Why AI agents are struggling with modern websites\n- The surprising connection to human accessibility\n- Real examples of invisible failures\n- Legal, security, and social implications\n- Why this matters for business and society\n- Practical patterns that work for both humans and machines"

    "AI agents are called \"invisible users\" for two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **They're invisible to site owners** — Unless you're specifically tracking agent traffic (and most aren't), you have no idea how many agents visit your site or whether they succeed. They blend into analytics as slightly unusual sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Your interface is partly invisible to them** — They can't see your beautiful animations, don't notice subtle color changes, miss three-second toast notifications, and don't understand that a loading spinner means \"wait.\"\n",

   "source": "### Understanding Agent Diversity\n\nWhen I refer to \"AI agents\" throughout this notebook and book, I'm describing a diverse ecosystem with varying capabilities:\n\n**Server-based agents** (ChatGPT, Claude via API) access websites remotely from cloud infrastructure, without any inherited browser state or authentication.\n\n**CLI agents** (Claude Code, Cline) run as command-line tools on your local machine but fetch web content remotely - no session inheritance.\n\n**Browser agents** (Playwright, Selenium) use full browser automation to execute JavaScript and handle dynamic content, but they're slower and resource-intensive.\n\n**Browser extension assistants** (ChatGPT sidebar, Claude browser extension) run inside your browser and inherit your authenticated sessions, cookies, and proof-of-humanity tokens.\n\n**Local (SMOL) agents** are lightweight tools running entirely on your device with privacy-focused approaches.\n\n**IDE-integrated browser controls** (Google Antigravity) combine development environment features with browser capabilities.\n\n**Why this matters:** The failures described in this book affect these agents differently:\n\n- **Session access** varies - browser extensions inherit your authenticated sessions whilst external agents must authenticate independently\n- **JavaScript execution** differs - some agents run full browsers whilst others parse only static HTML\n- **State detection** capabilities range from sophisticated to simple \"URL didn't change = nothing happened\"\n- **Authentication** approaches differ fundamentally\n\n**The critical insight:** We cannot design for just one agent type. A pattern that works brilliantly for browser extensions might fail completely for server-based agents. This book focuses on universal patterns that work across the entire ecosystem.\n\nThroughout the book, when agent type matters, I'll specify which type. When I refer to \"agents\" generally, I mean patterns affecting the entire ecosystem.",

    "**Example multiplication effects:**\n",
    "- **Education gap:** Educated users craft better prompts → get better results → learn faster → gap widens\n",
    "- **Economic gap:** Wealthy users afford premium agents → higher productivity → more income → gap widens\n",
    "- **Language gap:** English speakers get better agent performance → access better information → advantage compounds\n",
    "- **Technical gap:** Tech-savvy users troubleshoot agent errors → complete more tasks → skills improve faster\n",

    "**Policy questions:**\n",
    "- Should agent access be considered a utility like electricity or internet?\n",

   "source": "---\n\n## Reflection Questions\n\nBefore you finish, consider:\n\n1. **In your work:** Which of the five failure patterns have you implemented? (Be honest—we all have)\n\n2. **In your experience:** Have you encountered websites that frustrated you in ways similar to how they frustrate AI agents?\n\n3. **Looking ahead:** How might agent-mediated commerce change your industry in the next 2-3 years?\n\n4. **Taking action:** What's the first quick win you could implement on your site this week?\n\n5. **Broader implications:** What are the ethical considerations of building systems that work better for those who can afford AI agents?\n\n6. **Legal preparedness:** How would you handle liability if an AI agent made a costly mistake using your site?\n\n---\n\n## A Critical Responsibility\n\nThis book addresses **two audiences**: developers who build websites, and people who use AI agents to interact with them. Both have distinct responsibilities.\n\n### For Developers: Fix What You Can Control\n\nThe technical patterns throughout this book—clear state, persistent errors, semantic structure, transparent pricing—improve experiences for everyone. When you implement agent-friendly design, you're not just helping AI systems. You're helping:\n\n- Screen reader users who rely on semantic HTML\n- Elderly users who miss disappearing notifications  \n- People with cognitive disabilities who struggle with hidden state\n- Users under stress who need explicit feedback\n\n**Your responsibility:** Implement patterns that work for all users. Use the Priority 1 quick wins from Chapter 9. Test with accessibility tools. Fix the invisible failures.\n\n### For Users: Careful Prompts for High-Stakes Services\n\n**Not everything can be fixed with better design.**\n\nThroughout this book, you've encountered three categories that don't have technical solutions you can implement with HTML:\n\n1. **Banking security** (Chapter 6) — Session inheritance, verification paradoxes, unclear liability\n2. **Legal liability** (Chapter 7) — Grey zones, undefined frameworks, cross-border complexity  \n3. **Speculative commerce** (Chapter 4) — Dark warehouses, identity delegation, business model disruption\n\nThese aren't problems developers fix with code. They're environments where **the instructions you give to AI agents matter enormously**.\n\n### The High-Stakes Scenarios\n\n**Banking:** When you authorize an agent to access your bank account, you're accepting risk. If the agent misinterprets \"transfer £500 to my savings\" as \"transfer £5,000,\" you may be liable. The bank's security systems can't distinguish you from your agent.\n\n**Legal services:** When an agent fills out legal forms or interprets contracts on your behalf, mistakes have consequences. Ambiguous instructions like \"agree to standard terms\" could commit you to obligations you didn't intend.\n\n**Commercial transactions:** When agents make purchases, book services, or enter contracts, you're responsible for the outcomes. \"Book the cheapest flight\" might mean the flight with the worst cancellation policy.\n\n### What This Means for Agent Users\n\n**Be specific with prompts.** Don't say \"pay my bills\"—specify which bills, how much, when. Don't say \"book a hotel\"—provide dates, location, price range, requirements.\n\n**Verify before authorizing.** Review what the agent plans to do before it executes. Check confirmations independently. Don't assume success just because the agent reports success.\n\n**Understand your liability.** When you delegate authority to an agent, you're accepting responsibility for its actions. Agent platforms typically disclaim liability for mistakes. You're on your own if something goes wrong.\n\n**Use appropriate authorization levels.** Grant minimal access needed. Read-only for information gathering. Limited transaction authority for specific purchases. Never share credentials unless absolutely necessary.\n\n### The Dual Responsibility\n\nAgent-friendly design helps. Clear interfaces reduce ambiguity. Persistent feedback prevents silent failures. Transparent pricing avoids surprises.\n\nBut careful, considered use of agents is equally important. \n\n**Developers:** Build clarity into your interfaces. Fix the patterns that break for everyone.\n\n**Users:** Craft precise prompts when stakes are high. Verify outcomes independently. Understand the liability you're accepting.\n\nThis book addresses both. Technical patterns make systems clearer. User awareness prevents costly mistakes.\n\n**The future of agent-mediated interaction depends on both responsibilities being taken seriously.**"

   "source": "---\n\n### The Market Timing Matters\n\nYou can learn these lessons through months of failed conversions and support tickets. Or you can learn them from someone who's already documented the patterns.\n\n**This knowledge is valuable now because it's scarce.** You're reading this during the transition period - after the problem has emerged, before solutions have standardised. In two years, competitors will exist. In five years, agent compatibility will be as routine as mobile responsiveness, and this becomes commoditized knowledge. The window for gaining competitive advantage is limited.\n\nThe time saved researching these patterns yourself - weeks or months of experimentation and failed implementations - represents significant value.\n\n---\n\n### Thank you for exploring The Invisible Users\n\nThis notebook introduced you to the collision between AI agents and modern web design, covering all 10 chapters and practical resources. The full repository provides the depth, detail, and working code you need to build websites that work for everyone—human and machine alike.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ddttom/invisible-users.git`\n- Read the full manuscript starting with [Preface](invisible-users/preface.md)\n- Explore [Code Examples](invisible-users/code-examples/README.md) for your tech stack\n- Test with the [Agent-Friendly Starter Kit](invisible-users/agent-friendly-starter-kit/README.md)\n- Use the [Implementation Checklist](invisible-users/implementation-checklist.md) to prioritize fixes\n- Reference [advice.md](invisible-users/advice.md) for quick prescriptive guidance\n- Share your learnings and improvements\n\nRemember: **By building for machines, we might finally create the clearer, more honest web we should have built all along.**",
