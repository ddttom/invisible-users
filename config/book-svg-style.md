# SVG Illustration Requirements

Each chapter requires one SVG illustration following these specifications.

**File location:**

- All SVG files are stored in the `illustrations/` folder relative to each book
- Naming convention: `chapter-XX-[descriptive-name].svg`

**Technical specifications:**

- Viewbox: 800x500 or 900x600 (consistent within book)
- Background: #ffffff (white) - mandatory for all illustrations
- Font family: system-ui, sans-serif (or Georgia for titles)
- Export format: SVG with embedded styles

**Visual style:**

- Clean, professional appearance
- Colour coding for concepts (green = working/good, amber/red = broken/problem)
- Dashed borders for failure states
- Solid borders for success states
- Clear labels and annotations
- No decorative elements - every visual serves a purpose

**Content approach:**

- Each illustration should capture the chapter's central concept
- Split-view comparisons work well (human vs agent, before vs after)
- Flow diagrams for processes
- Side-by-side contrasts for differences
