## Practical Implementation Guides

Comprehensive guides and reference materials for developers:

### Core Guides

- [Building HTML for AI Agents (advice.md)](invisible-users/advice.md): Comprehensive prescriptive guide for creating web interfaces that work for both humans and AI agents (~9,000 words). Covers HTML patterns, form design, structured data, server-side patterns, testing, and implementation priorities.
- [HTML Patterns for AI Agents (AI-design-rules.md)](invisible-users/AI-design-rules.md): Quick reference for AI assistants generating HTML with explicit state, semantic markup, and machine-readable attributes (~1,200 words). Includes data attribute reference, form field names, and practical code examples.
- [AI-Native Web Architecture (AI-Native.blog)](invisible-users/AI-Native.blog): Complete technical blueprint for building AI-native websites using 7-layer architecture: Network, Knowledge, Action, Data, Permission, Authority, Interaction layers (~5,000 words)

### Code Examples

- [Agent-Friendly Starter Kit](invisible-users/agent-friendly-starter-kit/): Production-ready code examples demonstrating good vs bad patterns for AI agent compatibility
- Platform Configurations: Apache, Nginx, Next.js, WordPress, Adobe EDS, Static Sites
- Validation Tools: Development and production verification scripts
- Monitoring Examples: Server log analysis and analytics tracking

### Reference Materials

- [Glossary](invisible-users/Glossary.md): 60+ technical terms with cross-references
- [Implementation Checklist](invisible-users/implementation-checklist.md): Priority-based implementation roadmap from critical quick wins to advanced features
- [Resource Links](invisible-users/resource-links.md): 150+ curated resources organized by category
- [Example llms.txt](invisible-users/llms.txt): Real-world llms.txt from Digital Domain Technologies (allabout.network) demonstrating comprehensive structure with 91 posts across 6 categories

## Key Concepts

### The Convergence Principle

What AI agents need is mostly what everyone needs. Solutions that work for agents typically improve experiences for users with accessibility needs, people with ADHD, stressed parents, and others. The book argues that fixing invisible failures for AI benefits all users.

### Session Inheritance Problem

Critical security insight explored in Chapter 6: In-browser agents inherit authenticated sessions rather than failing to authenticate. Banks cannot detect AI involvement because agents inherit proof-of-humanity tokens from the authenticated user's session.

### Identity Delegation

When agents make purchases, businesses lose customer identity. Discussed briefly in Chapters 4, 6, 9, and 10 as one emerging solution pattern. Multiple approaches acknowledged (retailer-specific tokens, centralised repositories, blockchain attestations, browser-native delegation) without prescribing a specific implementation.

### Dual Responsibility Framework

The book addresses two audiences with distinct responsibilities:

- **For Developers:** Fix technical patterns (clear state, persistent errors, semantic structure) that improve experiences for all users
- **For Users:** Exercise care with prompts when dealing with banking, legal services, or commercial transactions where mistakes have serious consequences

Not everything can be fixed with better HTML design. Users bear responsibility for the instructions they give to AI agents when interacting with high-stakes services. Covered in Preface and interactive notebook.

### Established vs Emerging Standards

The book clearly distinguishes between:

- **Established Standards:** Schema.org, semantic HTML, ARIA - use with confidence
- **Emerging Conventions:** llms.txt - early adoption phase
- **Proposed Patterns:** ai-* meta tags, data-agent-visible - experimental but forward-compatible

## Interactive Materials

- [Interactive Notebook](invisible-users/invisible-users.ipynb): Interactive Jupyter notebook with visual demonstrations, data tables, and calculations. Hosted at [allabout.network/invisible-users.html](https://allabout.network/invisible-users.html). Time to complete: 60-75 minutes. Features chapter index, visual comparisons, cost impact tables, priority roadmaps, and user responsibility guidance.
