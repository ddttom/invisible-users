# MX Series: Book Manuscripts and Web Audit Suite

Two integrated book manuscripts and a production-ready implementation tool. Built on a multi-submodule architecture (updated 24 January 2026) enabling modular content management: main repository hub, MX-Bible (formerly "The Invisible Users"), MX-Handbook, MX-Gathering (community resources), shared appendices, shared code examples, UCP reference, and private outputs submodule.

**Recent Updates (29 January 2026):**

- Repository reorganization: Centralized folder structure documentation at config/system/folder-layout.md
- Symlinks removed: All convenience symlinks (books/, blogs/, AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md) removed to reduce navigation confusion
- ASCII diagrams: Replaced Mermaid diagrams with ASCII for universal compatibility
- Repository philosophy: Created config/system/repo-philosophy.md documenting design principles
- Architecture: 10 repositories total (1 main + 9 submodules)

**Last updated:** 29 January 2026

## Key Concepts

### The Convergence Principle

What AI agents need is mostly what everyone needs. Solutions that work for agents typically improve experiences for users with accessibility needs, people with ADHD, stressed parents, and others. The book argues that fixing invisible failures for AI benefits all users.

### Session Inheritance Problem

Critical security insight explored in Chapter 6: In-browser agents inherit authenticated sessions rather than failing to authenticate. Banks cannot detect AI involvement because agents inherit proof-of-humanity tokens from the authenticated user's session.

### Identity Delegation

When agents make purchases, businesses lose customer identity. Discussed briefly in Chapters 4, 6, 9, and 10 as one emerging solution pattern. Multiple approaches acknowledged (retailer-specific tokens, centralised repositories, blockchain attestations, browser-native delegation) without prescribing a specific implementation.

### Dual Responsibility Framework

The book addresses two audiences with distinct responsibilities:

- **For Developers:** Fix technical patterns (clear state, persistent errors, semantic structure) that improve experiences for all users
- **For Users:** Exercise care with prompts when dealing with banking, legal services, or commercial transactions where mistakes have serious consequences

Not everything can be fixed with better HTML design. Users bear responsibility for the instructions they give to AI agents when interacting with high-stakes services. Covered in Preface.

### Established vs Emerging Standards

The book clearly distinguishes between:

- **Established Standards:** Schema.org, semantic HTML, ARIA - use with confidence
- **Emerging Conventions:** llms.txt - early adoption phase
- **Proposed Patterns:** ai-* meta tags, data-agent-visible - experimental but forward-compatible
