## File Location: Always Check Root Directory First

**Rule** (2026-01-09): Tried to find LEARNINGS.md by searching subdirectories and checking if it existed in various locations, but the user pointed out "learnings.md is here @LEARNINGS.md this is one more eror to add, you did not look in the root." When looking for project-level files like LEARNINGS.md, README.md, CLAUDE.md, always check the root directory first before searching subdirectories. The root directory is where project-level documentation lives.

## Marketing Metrics from Company Announcements

**Rule** (2026-01-09): Tried using real Microsoft metrics (2x, 53%, 7x) from official announcements to demonstrate "measurable business impact," but CLAUDE.md explicitly forbids concrete percentages in marketing materials and the user correctly noted these "feel false to readers." Even when metrics come from real company announcements, they are unverifiable marketing claims, not independent research. Always replace specific percentages with qualitative statements like "Microsoft reports improved conversion rates (though unvalidated)" plus verifiable facts (dates, company names, partner retailers). Marketing percentages feel like hype regardless of source.
