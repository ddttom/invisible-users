## Deployment

To deploy this site:

1. **Upload all files** to your web server root or subdirectory
2. **Configure MIME types** (optional but recommended):
   - `.html` → `text/html; charset=utf-8`
   - `.txt` → `text/plain; charset=utf-8`
   - `.xml` → `application/xml; charset=utf-8`

3. **Update URLs** in the following files:
   - Change `https://allabout.network/invisible-users/web/site/` to your domain
   - Files to update: all HTML files (Schema.org URLs), sitemap.xml, llms.txt

4. **Test accessibility:**
   - Verify llms.txt at `https://yourdomain.com/llms.txt`
   - Verify sitemap.xml at `https://yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml`
   - Test all links work correctly

## Customization

To adapt these pages for your own use:

1. **Replace content** with your own text (keep the HTML structure)
2. **Update Schema.org JSON-LD** with your information
3. **Adjust styles** to match your brand (CSS is inline in each file)
4. **Modify meta tags** to reflect your content policy
5. **Keep semantic structure** and data attributes for AI compatibility
