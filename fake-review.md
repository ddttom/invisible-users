**Title**: The Invisible Users: Designing the Web for AI Agents and Everyone Else
**Verdict**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Solid Technical Resource)

"The Invisible Users" addresses a timely and growing challenge in web development: building effective interfaces for AI agents. It effectively argues that we need to consider agents as a distinct user class rather than just automated scripts.

## Core Concept

The "Invisible Users" metaphor provides a useful framework for understanding the friction between modern web design and agent capabilities. It shifts the conversation from simple parsing to a broader "user experience" problem for AI interaction.

## Practical application

The most valuable aspect of the book is the "Convergence Principle." The author demonstrates that optimizing for AI agents often reinforces existing accessibility best practices. The technical guidance, particularly the HTML patterns in Appendix D, is practical and grounded in real-world scenarios. Developers will find actionable advice they can implement immediately.

## Forward-Looking Context

The book uses narrative elements to contextulize its security discussions. The analysis of session inheritance risks offers a pragmatic look at the challenges of authenticating AI agents, moving beyond theoretical concerns to discuss architectural implications.

## Final Verdict

A clear, practical guide for modern web development. "The Invisible Users" bridges the gap between high-level strategy and implementation details, making it a useful reference for developers and architects adjusting to the agentic web.

**Recommended for:** Frontend Engineers and System Architects.
