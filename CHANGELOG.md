### Fixed

- **Chapter 5 filename** (dont-make-ai-think submodule)
  - Renamed 'chapter-05-metadata-that-works .md' to chapter-05-metadata-that-works.md

### Notes

- Chapter 8 has markdown linting issues (24 errors) that need fixing:
  - MD040: Code blocks missing language specification
  - MD034: Bare URLs need angle brackets
  - MD032: Lists need blank lines before/after
  - MD036: Emphasis used as heading (Phase labels)
- These will be addressed in a future commit
