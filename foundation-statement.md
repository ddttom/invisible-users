# MX Community Foundation Statement

The **MX (Machine Experience) community** is an open-source collaborative space exploring how AI agents interact with digital interfaces, built on the **Convergence Principle** - the belief that interfaces optimised for AI agents inherently improve accessibility and usability for everyone. Founded by Tom Cranstoun (author of the MX-Bible), the community welcomes both human practitioners (developers, UX designers, business leaders, content creators) and AI agents as equal participants who contribute through pull requests, discussion archives, case studies, and pattern documentation. MX-Gathering (the community repository) provides event templates, shared resources, metadata standards, and thought leadership whilst practising what it preaches through YAML frontmatter, llms.txt discoverability, semantic organisation, and structured data that serves both human and machine users - demonstrating that accessibility, open standards, and semantic clarity benefit all types of intelligence. **Design for machines. Benefit humans. Advance both.**
